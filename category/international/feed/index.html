<p><strong>By CLEMENTE BAUTISTA<br />
Kalibutan</strong></p>
<p>Last January I had the opportunity to visit <a href="http://www.yestolifenotomining.org/myanmar-philippines-exchange-peace-peoples-defence-land/">Myanmar</a> through a community-exchange and solidarity mission between <a href="http://www.yestolifenotomining.org/myanmar-philippines-exchange-peace-peoples-defence-land/">Philippines</a> and <a href="http://www.yestolifenotomining.org/myanmar-philippines-exchange-peace-peoples-defence-land/">Myanmar</a> groups. I first participated in the workshop organized by Karen Environmental and Social Action Network (KESAN) in Salween Peace Park in Papun District, Karen State. Then I was one of the resource persons in the 4th National Meeting of <a href="http://www.yestolifenotomining.org/myanmar-philippines-exchange-peace-peoples-defence-land/">Myanmar</a> Mining Watch Network (MMWN) in Tuanggyi City, Shan State. In both activities, I shared the people’s movement in the <a href="http://www.yestolifenotomining.org/myanmar-philippines-exchange-peace-peoples-defence-land/">Philippines</a> in relation to big corporate mining and engagement of environmental groups in the peace negotiation.</p>
<h6>Indigenous people asserting their territories, protecting their natural wealth</h6>
<p>In December 18, 2018, the Karen people formally declared the establishment of the Salween Peace Park, a 5,485-square kilometer forest park in Hpapun District, Karen State. The area has a wealth of natural resources, high biodiversity, unique ecological landscape and rich cultural heritage of Karen, one of the biggest indigenous people groups in <a href="http://www.yestolifenotomining.org/myanmar-philippines-exchange-peace-peoples-defence-land/">Myanmar</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_106431" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-106431" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/karen_Bev.jpg" alt="Beverly and Karen" width="800" height="575" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/karen_Bev.jpg 800w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/karen_Bev-508x365.jpg 508w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/karen_Bev-768x552.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">A member of KESAN explains the principles and objectives of Salween Peace Park to Philippine Katribu&#8217;s Beverly Longid (right) .

<p>The peace park is an expression and integration of Karen people’s right to self-determination, natural resource management, environmental protection, and good governance. This is an effort by different institutions led by KESAN and representatives of indigenous people groups in the area. They were able to get the Karen National Union (KNU) and the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) as partners in the Salween Peace Park which for 70 years have been asserting their own independent state from the Burmese government.</p>
<p>In the park, areas are classified for different uses and limitations. There are areas home to wildlife and endemic species. These are off-limits to human settlements or production activities.</p>
<p>Forest areas are classified for different uses such as agroforest, communal, or protected. Destructive projects like large dam and large-scale mining are prohibited in the park.</p>
<p>While the peace park ensures the ecological conservation and people-centered resource management, it is still facing great challenges and grave threats.</p>
<figure id="attachment_106432" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-106432" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kalibutan_salween_peace_Park_rivers.jpg" alt="Karen Peace Park" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kalibutan_salween_peace_Park_rivers.jpg 800w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kalibutan_salween_peace_Park_rivers-487x365.jpg 487w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kalibutan_salween_peace_Park_rivers-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Salween Peace Park is crisscrossed by rivers and contains different ecological systems.

<p><strong>Targeted as dam site, mining tenement</strong></p>
<p>Known for its rich natural resources for power generation and mineral extraction, the Burmese government identified the area for commercial mineral extraction and site of mega-dam project. The communities inside the Salween Peace Park have opposed the large-scale gold mining there.</p>
<p>Communities have been vocal in fighting the large-scale mining proposed by the Burma government and local officials. As of now, the communities are keeping at bay the Burmese government and corporate mining in exploiting their park.</p>
<p>The Karen people also have been campaigning for more than a decade against the construction of the 1,365 MegaWatt Hatgyi Dam which is being pushed by the Burmese government along with Thai and Chinese companies. If the project pushed through, it will result to the displacement of tens of thousands of indigenous peoples and flooding of communities and ecosystems along the Salween River. Until now, the dam proponents are failing to overcome the opposition of the people in the project area.</p>
<p>To impose these destructive projects, the Burmese government continues to deploy military to the Karen State and the Salween Peace Park. There are now more than 300 Burmese military detachments in Karen State, 80 of which are in the Salween Peace Park.</p>
<p>This has resulted in several armed encounters between the KNLA and the Burmese army. In communities which are near Burmese military detachment, residents find it hard to live in peace. Numerous human rights violations by Burmese military against Karen people were recorded.</p>
<p><strong>Myanmar Mining Watch Network (MMNW), people’s unity to defend their mineral resources </strong></p>
<p>MMWN is a national coalition of grassroots organizations from mining-affected areas representing different ethnicity, including Kachin, Kuki, Karen, Karenni, Chin, Ta’arng, Mon, Arakan and Shan in <a href="http://www.yestolifenotomining.org/myanmar-philippines-exchange-peace-peoples-defence-land/">Myanmar</a>.</p>
<p>During their meeting last January 14-16, 2018, I was able to share the mining situation and lessons and victories of people’s struggle against large-scale mining and resource plunder in the <a href="http://www.yestolifenotomining.org/myanmar-philippines-exchange-peace-peoples-defence-land/">Philippines</a>. I found out that there are a lot of similarities in the situation and struggle of both countries.</p>
<p>Large-scale mining in <a href="http://www.yestolifenotomining.org/myanmar-philippines-exchange-peace-peoples-defence-land/">Myanmar</a> and the <a href="http://www.yestolifenotomining.org/myanmar-philippines-exchange-peace-peoples-defence-land/">Philippines</a> have resulted to wholesale land-grabbing, massive environmental destruction, widespread human rights violations, and fast natural resource depletion. Large-scale mining projects are being promoted and protected by both national governments. They used the military to force the entry and operations of the mining companies in peasant and indigenous communities.</p>
<p>The MMWN is a collective effort of the people to unify their struggle and coordinate their campaigns. Same with Kalikasan People’s Network for the Environment (Kalikasan) and Philippine groups, MMWN calls for a radical change in the mining policy of the Burmese government. Primary demand in their campaign is the respect for land rights and the right to self-determination of the indigenous people.</p>

<p><strong>International solidarity in Southeast Asia Region</strong></p>
<p>The community exchange between the <a href="http://www.yestolifenotomining.org/myanmar-philippines-exchange-peace-peoples-defence-land/">Philippines</a> and <a href="http://www.yestolifenotomining.org/myanmar-philippines-exchange-peace-peoples-defence-land/">Myanmar</a> is part of an effort to strengthen the solidarity between people organizations in Southeast Asia Region. It is an initiative of Kalikasan, International Movement for Self Determination and Liberation (IPMSDL)  and the international coalition <a href="http://www.yestolifenotomining.org/myanmar-philippines-exchange-peace-peoples-defence-land/">Yes to Life No to Mining</a> Network (YLNM). We have partnered with KESAN and MMWN to realize the solidarity activities.</p>
<p>The idea of exchange came up and was planned during the two mining workshops organized both by the International People’s Conference on Mining (IPCM) and YLNM during the Asia-Europe People’s Forum in Ghent, Belgium in September 30, 2018. Then, on another workshop during the Thematic Social Forum on Mining and Extractives in Johannesburg, South Africa in November 12, 2018.</p>
<p>The exchange provided the venue to learn from the experiences and lessons of the struggle of grassroots organizations and communities affected by extractive projects. At the same time we know the exchange will identify emblematic cases of successful initiatives of communities in relation to their resistance to large-scale mining and management of their natural resources. The MMWN and the Salween Peace Park are examples of emblematic cases.</p>
<p>On April 2019, it will be the turn of people’s organizations in <a href="http://www.yestolifenotomining.org/myanmar-philippines-exchange-peace-peoples-defence-land/">Myanmar</a> to send their leaders and representatives to the celebration of Cordillera Day. It is national commemoration of the death anniversary of Macli-ing Dulag, a great tribal leader in the 1980’s which led the indigenous people Igorots in defending their lands, rights and resources against the World Bank funded Chico Dam project. They successfully stopped the project and continue their tradition of resistance.</p>
<p>In the heroism of Macli-ing, in the spirit of the resistance of the Karen and Igorot people, we will continue to strengthen the solidarity between the people of the <a href="http://www.yestolifenotomining.org/myanmar-philippines-exchange-peace-peoples-defence-land/">Philippines</a> and <a href="http://www.yestolifenotomining.org/myanmar-philippines-exchange-peace-peoples-defence-land/">Myanmar</a>. <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<strong>BLOOD RUSH<br />
By SARAH RAYMUNDO</strong></p>
<p>It was the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month of 1918.* World War I ended following the signing of an armistice (truce) between the Allies (France, Great Britain, Italy, United States) and Germany. Also known as the “Great War” or the “war to end all wars” on account of its death toll and overall destruction, WWI killed 10 million military personnel, almost seven million civilians and six million disappeared and never surfaced. What came out of the Armistice is the Treaty Versailles or the Peace Treaty drafted by the leaders of the Allies. To say that the Peace Treaty was punitive of Germany is to underestimate its role in the division of world into imperialist powers through multi-lateral institutions and territories under their control. The world as we know it now is largely shaped by this event one hundred years ago. Yet we are seldom encouraged to see the world through its continuing past.</p>
<p><strong>Remember to break free</strong></p>
<p>In the following, I offer a commemoration of the centennial of the Armistice. But not as a mode of learning from the past in order for us not to repeat its horrors. Learning from history is also about outmanueuvering the tendencies of powerful structures. I argue that the ideological constellation that came out of Armistice is the same ideological constellation that limits the way we think of the present and past, and imagine the future. In short, we are still the contemporaries of the people of the Armistice. Hence, this commemoration is less a freeing of some suppressed knowledge but an occasion to think of how to break free from this one hundred years freeze frame.</p>
<p>Mainstream accounts of WWI focus on the ideological struggle between democracy and autocracy. They are all about the tendencies of states and leaders as special figures or personalities. The same accounts almost always end with an argument that an allied victory led to the maintenance and even extension of liberal democracy in Europe and North America. But don’t we also know that these countries identified as “sharing a democratic heritage” such as Great Britain, France and the United States were large colonial empires that implemented the worst forms of violence among colonized peoples while maintaining some semblance of democracy in the homefront? This and other questions can be explained partially by what also took place around the same time—a break in Russian history, the Bolshevik Revolution that turned 100 years in 2017.</p>
<p>Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin sharply identified the First and Second World Wars as imperialist wars. While I think that Lenin’s theory of imperialism remains indispensable in analyzing the dynamics, contradictions and possible points of solidarity between the Global South and the dominant North, it is important to emphasize the significant contribution of this theory in our understanding of racial capitalism. For Lenin, imperialism is the highest stage of capitalism resolving its crisis of overproduction, and one of the most profitable ways to resolve this crisis is by going to war. “Imperialism means war.”</p>
<p>What does it mean to understand world wars as imperialist wars and to see the world from an anti-imperialist lens? In the following account, Losurdo carefully notes how Lenin</p>
<p>“refuse[s] to attribute the outbreak of the First World War exclusively to an imaginary German people, massively and consistently militaristic and bellicose throughout its history. One fact is especially significant. Although the Bolshevik leader regarded the Brest-Litovsk peace as rapacious, he compared Soviet Russia’s struggle against German imperialism to the struggle against Napoleon’s invasion and the occupation waged by Prussia, albeit that it was led by the Hohenzollerns, while Napoleon was in turn defined as ‘another plunderer like the Hohenzollerns’ The line of demarcation between progress and reaction, and between forces of peace and forces of war, is not definable once and for all; at all events, it never coincides with an ethnic boundary. What is required is concrete analysis of a concrete situation.”</p>
<p>“Whatever our political and moral judgement of Stalin,” Losurdo adds, “it remains the case that, with Lenin’s lesson in mind, he stressed that the genesis and modality of war ‘cannot be explained by the personal characteristics of the Japanese and the Germans.” It is worth noting that Bolshevik leaders were themselves ethnic/national minorities.</p>
<p>The Bolshevik Revolution’s break from Russian Tsarism through a socialist revolution allowed them to imagine and to a considerable extent realize a society that is not essentially defined by national boundaries, race, and ethnicity, and a system other than capitalism. From the Soviet communists, we learn that patriotism is about winning the struggle for national liberation against imperialism; and anti-imperialism means embracing proletarian internationalism and socialist revolution.</p>
<p><strong>What Now?</strong>**</p>
<p>One hundred years after the Armistice, we are confronted by militarized villages where farmers toil on land monopolized by landlord-politicians, homeless people in decaying urban streets, unemployed, semi-proletariats, exploited workers in slums and/or urban poor enclaves. Migrants seeking refuge and currently marching shoulder-to-shoulder because of the dispossessive and violent logic of capital.</p>
<p>The Armistice paved the way for the creation of the League of Nations (League) that controlled the “mandates” or the assignment of the colonies of the defeated powers of Austria, Germany, and the Ottoman Empire to the Allies. During “peacetime,” the League took a look at Palestine and decided it was not ready for independence. That it became a mandate of Great Britain was good news for the Zionists. Great Britain’s Balfour Declaration of November 1917 fully supported the formation of a Jewish State in Palestine, which is now the Apartheid State of Israel.</p>
<p>The agreements and borders imposed by the Treaty of Versailles which partitioned the Middle East as colonies of the Allied forces had set the stage for a turbulent century for the Arab people. The war in Syria, the genocide in Yemen, even the war on drugs and extra-judicial killings in our very own country are evidences of how the crisis of global capitalism cannot maintain a semblance of liberal democracy. The atrocities of our time are not mere symptoms of liberal democracy’s dysfunctions but rather the logical result of a system that survives through exploitation and war.</p>
<p>Yet the current ideological constellation is still faithful to the conditions during the end of the Great War: liberal democracy or authoritarianism? Two sides of the same capitalist coin. Historically, and when capitalism afforded it, it made the vote of the people from the dominant North count but not for the working people of color. And never ever in the case of countries in the Global South where liberal democracy has never been more than a colonial imposition whose perfection is supposed to be every colonized native’s dream.</p>
<p>We are still suffering from a crisis-ridden capitalist system for which the First World War was fought and resolved and for which the superpowers imposed a division of the world that continues to emplace our lives and labors. We are still living and dying for the same system for which great wars were fought and ended so that proxy wars and multi-lateral formations like the United Nations (League of Nations resurrected), International Monetary Fund, World Bank, NATO, ASEAN, APEC, and the like will continue to consolidate, retool and recast, whenever necessary, the profits and liberties won by imperialist powers one hundred years ago.<a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a>  </p>

<p>By <strong>JANESS ANN J. ELLAO</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em> </p>
<p>MANILA – Guilty.</p>
<p>This is the verdict of the recently-concluded International People’s Tribunal (IPT) against President Rodrigo Duterte, US President Donald Trump, and international monetary organizations, which was held in Brussels, Belgium from Sept. 18 to 19. </p>
<p>Victims of human rights violations took turns in providing their respective testimonies before panelists from international human rights and lawyers organizations as they detailed how Duterte, Trump, and international monetary organizations violated the political and economic rights, and the right to self-determination of the Filipino people. </p>
<p>“The fact that Defendant Duterte was a president the people voted for, meant that the people had entertained the hope that they might expect a more democratic regime after years of rude dictatorship. That hope of the people implied a moral obligation of Defendant Duterte towards the people. The human rights violations that are proven by the different witnesses are therefore also a serious betrayal. On the contrary, he has persisted with quite disturbing viciousness in continuing previous governments’ gross and wholesale violations against the Filipino people,” the verdict read. </p>
<p>The IPT was convened by the European Association of Lawyers for Democracy and World Human Rights (ELDH), Haldane Society of Socialist Lawyers, International Association of Democratic Lawyers (IADL), Ibon International, and the International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines (ICHRP).</p>
<p><strong>Rampant killings</strong></p>
<p>Cristina Palabay, Karapatan secretary general, said there were 169 politically-motivated killings under Duterte, out of which 104 were committed in Mindanao where martial law rule is currently in place. She added that they have also documented at least 11 massacres.</p>
<p>“It has been observed that there is a dangerous formula in these killings – a pattern that takes after the modus operandi widely used by the bloody regime of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo,” said Palabay, adding that these include the use of motorcycle in carrying out the killings, the concerted effort to make it appear as if it is a petty crime, and to dismiss it as an isolated incident. </p>
<p>Palabay also pointed out how Duterte’s counterinsurgency program, Oplan Kapayapaan, has been used to protect haciendas, plantations, and mining corporations, resulting in rights abuses against peasants and indigenous peoples, including the attacks against alternative tribal schools that teach students, among others, to defend their ancestral domain.   </p>
<p>So far, nearly half a million Filipinos have forcibly evacuated due to militarization of their communities. Palabay said their tribal leaders, teachers, and students have been subjected to vilification. </p>
<p>Drug-related killings were also brought before the attention of the IPT jurors. </p>
<p>“Regardless if it is 4,000 or 23,000 killed, one killing is one killing is too many. These people are not just numbers. They are human beings,” said Ritche Masegman of Rise Up for Life, an ecumenical network of advocates against drug-related killings. </p>
<p><strong>On political prisoners, persecution </strong></p>
<p>Palabay said that instead of releasing political prisoners as earlier promised by Duterte during the peace negotiations with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines, many activists have been arrested, with nearly a thousand facing trumped-up charges. </p>
<p>“Those that they could not kill, the Duterte regime arrests, plants evidence against, and charges them with non-bailable crimes,” Palabay noted.  </p>
<p>Eleanor de Guzman and Belle Castillo, who are daughters of detained peace consultants Rafael Baylosis and Ferdinand Castillo, respectively, testified before the IPT on the ordeal of their fathers. </p>

<p>The IPT also looked into the tirades of Duterte against activists and human rights advocates, and, most especially on women. Gabriela secretary general Joms Salvador said Duterte’s rape jokes are not a laughing matter in light of increased reported cases of rape, including in the president’s hometown in Davao. </p>
<p>“Women are vilified in a shocking fashion, scorned and ridiculed. Rape cases and other attacks on women have tremendously increased,” the verdict read. </p>
<p>Sr. Patricia Fox, an Australian nun who is currently being threatened to be deported after nearly three decades of serving the poor in the Philippines, also testified before the court and narrated her ordeal on the cancellation of her missionary visa. Duterte himself admitted he personally ordered her arrest. </p>
<p>“As a human being, as a religious, we have to stand with the oppressed,” said Fox, adding that the threats of deportation against her is a “human rights issue.”</p>
<p>Fox said the Duterte administration is hell bent on having her deported because his government could not take criticisms, especially on the human rights abuses in Mindanao. </p>
<p>For one, Katribu secretary general Piya Malayao, one of the witnesses, pointed out how Moro communities are also constantly militarized. She said that the infamous Marawi siege not only destroyed the culture and heritage of the Moro people but also resulted to their displacement. </p>
<p>The members of the media, too, were not spared, said Palabay. </p>
<p>Under Duterte, 13 journalists have been killed. This does not include those who were threatened or arrested during their coverage, such as the case of the arrest of five journalists from alternative media network, AlterMidya People’s Media Network, during NutriAsia dispersal. </p>
<p><strong>On economic rights</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_104723" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/09/20/intl-tribunal-duterte-trump-guilty-violating-political-economic-rights-filipino-people/ipt2018-jonb-51medium_large-1537320363/" rel="attachment wp-att-104723"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IPT2018-jonb-51medium_large.1537320363.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" class="size-full wp-image-104723" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IPT2018-jonb-51medium_large.1537320363.jpg 800w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IPT2018-jonb-51medium_large.1537320363-548x365.jpg 548w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IPT2018-jonb-51medium_large.1537320363-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IPT2018-jonb-51medium_large.1537320363-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(Photo courtesy of Jon Bustamante)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The IPT also looked into the violations of the socio-economic rights of the people. Witnesses from various sectors provided their respective testimonies, which ranged from those discussing peasant, labor, housing, education livelihood, women’s rights, to migrant’s rights. </p>
<p>Raoul Manuel, deputy secretary general of the National Union of Students in the Philippines pointed out that education in the Philippines, most especially in colleges and universities, is largely a “capitalist education” as it is owned by big conglomerates. </p>
<p>Students are barred from joining progressive organizations. Campus newspapers are also being censored. </p>
<p>George San Mateo of Piston also assailed Duterte’s indifference to the plight of the jeepney drivers in the face of a jeepney phaseout. </p>
<p>“We are not against the jeepney modernization. We just want it to be socially just. But they won’t listen to us. They just want to carry out what they have initially planned,” Mateo said. </p>
<p>In tears, Celia Veloso, mother of Filipina on death row in Indonesia Mary Jane, talked about the ordeal of her daughter, who she said became vulnerable to human trafficking because of poverty.  </p>
<p>The verdict stipulated that Duterte consistently failed to provide the basic rights of the people and has instead imposed new taxes that hit primarily the poor and the marginalized. </p>
<p>“Farmers are deprived of the lands they have tilled for ages and are attacked; workers are exploited and their strikes violently dispersed; the urban poor remain homeless and threatened when they assert their rights; education is commercialized and inaccessible to the great majority; thousands are forced to migrate daily including nurses under a labor export policy; the right to livelihood is curtailed; distressed overseas workers are neglected and abandoned,” the verdict read. </p>
<p><strong>On the U.S. role</strong></p>
<p>Marjorie Cohn, former president of US’ National Lawyers’ Guild, also testified how the U.S. and the Philippine governments connived to violate the right of the Filipino people to self-determination. </p>
<p>“For the past 17 years, under Bush, Obama, and Trump, the U.S. government provides military support, which enables it to commit more crimes and crimes against humanity against its own people and deny them their right to self-determination,” she said during her testimony. </p>
<p>She cited that the US government’s Operation Enduring Freedom was used by the Philippines to wage war against its own people, which mostly targeted activists. </p>
<p>Cohn also hit the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, which was signed between former President Benigno S. Aquino III and Barack Obama, that provided vast powers to American forces in Philippine soil. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Duterte had a friendly meeting with Trump, which signaled the beginning of pro-US policies, including the resumption of joint military exercises and war games, adding that the US military support may hold their political and military leaders liable before the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p>Cohn revealed that for 2017 to 2018, the US government has provided more than $175 million in military assistance, allowing the Philippine government to carry out its new counterinsurgency program Oplan Kapayapaan. </p>
<p>The verdict stipulated that Duterte has “essentially demonstrated his allegiance to U.S. imperialist goals in the Asia-Pacific region. The Defendant Duterte government also overturned anew the victory of the people in removing US military bases,” due to the presence and expanding US presence in the Philippines. </p>
<p><strong>Last tribunal</strong></p>

<p>The Philippine government did not send any representation to the two-day proceedings, which they dismissed as a mere  “<a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/09/18/18/palace-calls-international-tribunal-proceedings-a-sham">propaganda proceeding from the Left</a>” and that it is a “sham.” </p>
<p>Jeanne Mirrer, president of the IADL, one of the convenors, said the tribunal is necessary to “create a people’s record of what is happening.&#8221; </p>
<p>“It is the moral authority of the people who are victimized, impoverished, and repressed by the governments and use its moral platform to fight back to build their own authority when states do not act to protect their rights,” she said. </p>
<p>Jan Fermon of the IADL, for his part, found it unfortunate that this is not the first time that the Philippine government has been found guilty by the International People’s Tribunal, citing the 1980 tribunal against former dictator Ferdinand Marcos, the <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2005/08/27/people-of-the-philippines-vs-arroyo/">2005 tribunal</a> against former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and former US President George W. Bush, and the <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/07/19/ipt-2015-us-ph-govt-guilty-of-rights-violations-tribunal/">2015 tribunal</a> against former President Benigno Aquino III and US President Barrack Obama. </p>
<p>All three past tribunals, Fermon said, found the governments of the Philippines and the United States and international monetary organizations guilty of gross crimes against the Filipino people. </p>
<p>The verdict pointed out that the narratives presented during the proceedings were “eerily familiar and oftentimes similar to previous violations that past peoples’ tribunals have covered. And yet the Defendant Duterte has created new forms of attacks and intensified the old ones.”</p>
<p>He added, “let us hope that this will be the last people’s tribunal on the Philippines. Let us hope that the Filipino people will be able to get rid of the domination of criminals that rule their country for decades.” <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a> </p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA – For that day of reckoning like what happened to the just-convicted retired Army major Gen. Jovito Palparan Jr., various people’s organizations led by Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) and Karapatan announced at a press conference this Monday, September 17, that they would testify in an International People’s Tribunal in Brussels, Belgium against Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. </p>
<p>The International Peoples’ Tribunal (IPT2018) will be held on September 18 to 19. Filipino victims of rights violations will testify to indict Presidents Rodrigo Duterte and Donald Trump “for crimes against the people.”</p>
<p>The International People’s Tribunal is a global court convened by the European Association of Lawyers for Democracy and World Human Rights (ELDH), Haldane Society of Socialist Lawyers, International Association of Democratic Lawyers (IADL), Ibon International, and the International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines (ICHRP). Jigs Clamor of Karapatan said this tribunal is a vital part of the Filipino people’s growing resistance to tyranny, fascism, militarism, foreign intervention and war of aggression. </p>
<p>“An impartial tribunal, recognized internationally, could serve as moral suasion to stop the attacks and make the regime accountable for its crimes,” Clamor said. </p>
<p>At the press briefing, they reiterated that the global court derives its legitimacy from the people as the primordial source of authority and power of all courts – international or local. Composed of leading public figures of recognized achievements and high moral stature, they are expected to come up with a verdict based on a thorough and fair assessment of evidence, and in line with applicable legal standards.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/388938651/Cases-filed-at-IPT2018">The 21 cases the Filipinos filed before the IPT2018</a> reflect the ‘attacks of the Duterte government on the Filipino people,’ under his administration’s so-called war on drugs, counter-insurgency war, and war against ‘terrorists’ that in practice has become a war against national minorities and other vocal critics of the administration.</p>
<p>Bagong Alyansang Makabayan Teddy Casiño clarified that progressive Filipino people’s organizations are sending representatives to the IPT2018 to give testimonies even as they are still striving to seek justice and accountability through other avenues and in the local courts. Unfortunately, Casiño said, the judicial system itself is under attack in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Worse, according to Clamor, the judicial system in the Philippines is “beholden to vested interests of the US and local ruling warlords.” He said the continuing impunity of killings, state violence and violations of people’s rights attest to this. The extreme weaknesses of the local justice system in punishing rights violators have been driving various organizations to venues local and international that are open to documenting and broadcasting the said cases of rights violations. </p>
<p>In the past, international tribunals have indicted abusive regimes in the Philippines, as listed below:</p>
<p>&#8211;	In 1980, Antwerp, Belgium, at the first session of the Permanent People’s Tribunal dubbed as Repression and Resistance against the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos;<br />
&#8211;	In 2005, Manila, the International Solidarity Mission – International People’s Tribunal (ISM-IPT) against human rights violations committed by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo;<br />
&#8211;	In December 2005, Hongkong, Asia-Pacific Women’s Tribunal Against the World Trade Organization by the Asia-Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development;<br />
&#8211;	In March 2007, The Hague, Netherlands, the Permanent People’s Tribunal, second session on the Philippines, indicted the US-backed Arroyo regime for human rights violations, economic plunder, and transgression of Philippine sovereignty;<br />
&#8211;	In November 2012, Manila, at the International Migrants Tribunal;<br />
&#8211;	In 2015, Washington, DC, the International People’s Tribunal indicted President Benigno S. Aquino III and the US government represented by President Barack Obama for crimes against the Filipino people. </p>
<p>The Philippine government under President Duterte has been vocal against international bodies or courts probing into his human rights record. He has ordered the Philippine government’s pullout from the International Criminal Court. He has time and again <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/12/duterte-goes-war-un-threatens-throw-rights-team-crocodiles/">publicly taunted</a> Dr. Agnès S. Callamard, Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions at the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, for attempting to probe his regime’s human rights record. </p>
<p>As such, Casiño is not optimistic about President Duterte’s reaction to the Filipinos’ testimonies in the global court, especially since he and the rest of the representatives of the progressive organizations believe their airtight cases will likely prompt the IPT to indict Duterte. But they hope the “moral suasion” arising from the public documentation of Duterte’s crimes will help put a stop to the attacks and make his regime accountable for its crimes. </p>
<p>The findings and verdict of the IPT2018 will be submitted to the International Criminal Court (ICC), the European Parliament and the United Nations Human Rights Council on September 21 this year, coinciding with the anniversary of Martial Law in the Philippines.</p>
<p>“Although Duterte already withdrew from the Rome Statute creating the ICC, it will take a year upon the receipt of the notice of withdrawal according to Article 127 of the ICC. This rule was made specifically for dictators like Duterte who might withdraw while complaints are filed against them,” said Jerome Succor Aba, chairperson of Suara Bangsamoro who was prevented by authorities to fly to Belgium to testify.</p>
<p><strong>Documenting attacks on the people to stop such attacks, call for justice</strong></p>
<p>The broad categories on rights violations tackled in the Filipino groups’ testimonies include (1) civil and political rights, (2) economic, social and cultural rights, (ESCR) and (3) national sovereignty, development, and international humanitarian law. The cases filed in IPT represent what Karapatan’s Jigs Clamor described as “full-scale attacks of the Duterte government on the Filipino people.” </p>
<p>These include the mass murder of allegedly more than 23,000 poor Filipinos under Duterte’s war on drugs; and more than 160 extra-judicial killings of mostly peasant and indigenous leaders.</p>
<p>At present, Martial Law is in effect over Mindanao. Its proclamation has been questioned at the Supreme Court and in Congress for utter lack of basis, and its extension also for lack of basis. Petitioners against Martial Law cited how Duterte himself had announced that the Marawi siege, his justification for imposing Martial Law in the first place, was already over. Yet, as the 2018 deadline of the reextended Martial Law draws near, there are talks that Duterte might try to extend and expand Martial Law. </p>
<p>In just one year of Martial Law in Mindanao, Karapatan has documented at least 49 victims of extrajudicial killings, 22 documented cases of torture, 89 victims of illegal arrest and detention, and 336,124 victims of indiscriminate gunfire and aerial bombings. </p>
<p>These are only numbers representing those the rights advocates were able to document. There may be more, but fear of reprisal if victims or witnesses speak out, and lack of access to the victims, prevent the rights advocates’ full documentation. </p>
<p>Instead of putting a stop to killings, more of it has been happening, victimizing youth and civilian Moros and indigenous people, said Jerome Aladdin Succor Aba of Suara Bangsamoro. He cited the recent massacre of Tausug Moro youth in Patikul. These youth had notified the military in the area of their plan to harvest fruits in the mountain. But some Scout Rangers chanced upon them and brought them to a police detachment, Aba said. “The Scout Rangers took in the youths alive at noon on September 14. By late afternoon they returned these youths dead.”</p>
<p>The military said the killed youth were members of the Abu Sayyaf, but the communities from where they came vehemently denied it. Aba said the irony of this Martial Law and continuing killings in Mindanao is that it will breed further conflicts and war, instead of peace. “You kill civilians and youths who are just harvesting fruits, and you’d end up with a very very furious people,” he said. </p>
<p>The solution should have been attending to the people’s land problems, poverty, but the Duterte government is waging more wars, buying more arms, imposing greater taxes, Aba said. </p>
<p>Aba himself should have been part of the Filipino delegates to the IPT2018, but he was denied at immigration. Earlier this year, he had been denied entry to the United States, held for hours and interrogated by US Homeland Security allegedly for his alleged links to “terrorists.” As chairperson of Suara Bangsamoro, Aba was slated to testify on the charges regarding religious discrimination, arbitrary detention and torture committed against him by agents of US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) on April 17-19, 2018. </p>
<p>For the Moro, Sultan Hamidullah Atar of Marawi City will testify in the International Peoples’ Tribunal (IPT2018) to prosecute President Rodrigo Duterte for his crimes against the Moro and the Filipino people. </p>
<p>Trumped-up charges against leaders, activists and critics, including that of Senator and former justice secretary Leila de Lima, media repression, the drive to deport Sr. Patricia Fox and other foreign missionaries who have been joining fact-finding missions into shell-shocked communities, and the detention of more than 500 political prisoners, are also included in the charges to be heard in IPT2018.</p>
<p>KMU leader Lito Ustarez said they are sending representatives of strikers from NutriAsia, unionists from Sumifru in Mindanao, jeepney drivers, and operators’ groups, to present cases of ESCR violations. These include labor-only contracting, union-busting, landlessness, harassment of poor peasants and agricultural workers, corporatization of public transportation, among others. Ustarez said some KMU affiliates in Mindanao are being harassed by the military and considered as enemies of the state just for unionizing. Recently, some unionists managed to survive an ambush attempt, he said. </p>
<p>The groups under Bayan also filed cases against violations of international humanitarian law and the people’s right to national self-determination. They bring documentation on the attacks on 226 indigenous peoples’ schools in Mindanao by the AFP, PNP and the DepEd, bombings, and airstrikes of indigenous communities in Malibcong, Abra in March 2017, and the massacre of seven personnel of the National Democratic Front in August this year. They also bring cases against the intervention of the US military and government in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Asked why they did not just bring the cases direct to ICC, Jigs Clamor explained that they will, in fact, bring cases to the ICC. But he said the IPT will also be a huge help in spreading consciousness about the impunity in the Philippines. </p>
<p>The groups expressed their faith in the IPT 2018 jurors who form an international panel of eminent individuals from different disciplines, with proven competence, integrity, probity and objectivity. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a>            </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“…But what only the bureau fails to understand (or care about) is that you cannot predict that a person is fit to travel and not in danger from a deep vein thrombosis-which i have previously suffered-and nearly died from with a blood clot in my lung… it seems to me that the bureau is putting my life at risk.”</p>
<p>By <strong>RONALYN V. OLEA</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em> </p>
<p>MANILA — The Bureau of Immigration has ordered Australian lawyer and human rights defender Gil Boehringer to board a flight to Ghuangzhou, China then to Sydney at 12 noon today, August 14, according to Karapatan legal counsel Maria Sol Taule.</p>
<p>BI has held Boehringer in custody since he arrived at Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) Terminal 1<br />
on August 8. Immigration officials flatly told the 84-year-old human rights defender that he is in the agency’s blacklist.</p>
<p>Boehringer, who is married to a Filipina, has been prevented from entering the Philippines for allegations he has not been notified. Boehringer said nothing has been given to him in writing for the past six days. </p>
<p>Boehringer told <em>Bulatlat</em> in a message the BI has been adamant in deporting him even without medical assessment that he is fit to travel. Boehringer has a history of an almost fatal pulmonary embolism,  which is often caused by blood clots that travel to the lungs from the legs and deep vein thrombosis, or the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein. </p>
<p>Boehringer said that his own doctor and the airport doctors have certified that they were unable to determine if he was fit to travel. “…But what only the bureau fails to understand (or care about) is that you cannot predict that a person is fit to travel and not in danger from a deep vein thrombosis-which i have previously suffered-and nearly died from with a blood clot in my lung,” Boehringer said. “… it seems to me that the bureau is putting my life at risk.”</p>
<p>Boehringer said, “My lawyers are attempting to get the Bureau and/or the airline (which will be violating international law and my basic human right to travel safely etc) to do the right and just thing, the rational, logical thing:let me see a doctor in a facility outside the airport for an assessment and treatment that could make the difference!” </p>
<p><strong>Not terrorist</strong></p>
<p>Boehringer belied the allegations of the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (NICA) that he is a “communist terrorist.” </p>
<p>“I’m not a terrorist. I’m a human rights defender. I have attempted to enter in an intellectual way into the national dialogue on the problems of the Philippines and the policies of the government,” he said in a Facebook post.</p>
<p>Boehringer said this is “basically part of the campaign of the government undertaken to see to it that foreigners are not allowed into the country or removed” , citing the <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-ph/news/world/bi-confirms-leave-orders-for-3-methodist-missionaries-but-denies-%E2%80%98crackdown%E2%80%99-on-foreign-religious-workers/ar-AAzw90P">deportation of three young Methodist missionaries</a> from the United States, Zimbabwe and Malawi and the <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/07/19/australian-missionary-appeal-bis-deportation-order/">threat of deportation </a>against another Australian lawyer and missionary Patricia Ann Fox.  </p>
<p>The Australian human rights defender also denied BI’s claims that he participated in rallies in November 2015 in Manila and in February this year. </p>
<p>Boehringer confirmed that he went to Caraga region in February not to attend a rally but to observe the educational activities at a primary school for Lumad children run by the Tribal Filipino Program of Surigao del Sur (TRIFPSS).<br />
In a statement, the Confederation of Lawyers in Asia and the Pacific (COLAP)  condemned the denial of legal counsel and the immigration ban against Boehringer. </p>
<p>“Boehringer, is a known human rights lawyer and advocate of the rights of indigenous people, coming himself from Australia where there are serious violations of the rights of the aborigines. His advocacy for the rights of the Lumads in the Philippines and for other victims of human rights deserve commendation and not harassment by the Philippine authorities,” the group said.</p>
<p>COLAP maintained that the right to free speech is a universal right of all human beings regardless of nationality or citizenship. </em> <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a>  </p>

<strong>BLOOD RUSH<br />
By SARAH RAYMUNDO</strong></p>
<p><em>“…So this time let us skip all the sighing and promising and moments of silence. Why keep up the pretense that we are going to take any real and practical steps toward sanity? Everyone knows we are not going to do a single damn thing. We can’t. We are captives of The Gun.<br />
The Gun is patriotic.<br />
The Gun is America.<br />
The Gun is God.”<br />
								&#8211; Gary Willis, 2016</em></p>
<p>In her latest book,  “Loaded: A Disarming History of the Second Amendment (2018), historian  Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz,” offers a compelling account of the roots of gun culture in the United States. She clearly connects this history with the Second Amendment and explains how the violence of this connection has largely shaped the character of the US as an exceptional imperialist power responsible for the global reinforcement of racial capitalism and class violence. This connection, she argues, is crucial in understanding the conduct of the United States from its seizure of Native American land to its current “war on terror” that feeds into its very own lucrative military industrial complex. She cites Gary Willis’ satirical piece published in the Boston Globe after the Orlando club massacre that took away 49 lives to illustrate the maniacal sensibility behind the gun lobby that rests on a  “presumed sanctity of the Second Amendment.” </p>
<p><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/loaded-262x365.jpg" alt="" width="262" height="365" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-102639" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/loaded-262x365.jpg 262w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/loaded-768x1072.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/loaded-602x840.jpg 602w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/loaded.jpg 774w" sizes="(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px" /></p>
<p><strong>Loaded</strong></p>
<p>Dunbar-Ortiz critiques the “presumed sanctity of the Second Amendment” both by the National Rifle Association (NRA) and gun control advocates. The NRA invokes that the Second Amendment guarantees the rights of every individual to bear arms. Gun control advocates, however, aver that the Second Amendment is about states continuing to have their own well regulated militias as exemplified in the existence of the National Guard (2018:23). </p>
<p>Both positions take for granted the use of guns within a legal framework. In other words, and as Georgetown University law Professor David Cole suggests, “guns have such a strong appeal in the United States in comparison with other societies (23).” More to the point, Dunbar-Ortiz argues that “understanding the purpose of the Second Amendment is key to understanding the gun culture in the United States, and possibly the key to a new consciousness about the lingering effects of settler colonialism and white nationalism (23).” </p>
<p>The Second Amendment: “A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.”</p>
<p>The Second Amendment finds its way in US history during the late 18th century with the Anglo American settlers’ break with the British empire, followed by the conquest of Native American lands through the slaughter of indigenous peoples in order to extend the boundaries of the 13 colonies. This is largely a response to the 1763 Treaty of Paris that prompted King George III to issue a prohibition on the expansion of British settlement to the west of the Allegheny-Appalachian mountain chain. Anglo-American settlers who were already in those areas were ordered to immediately return to the 13 colonies. But thousands of settlers resisted the edict, consequently compelling the British authorities to deploy more soldiers to indigenous lands in order to implement the rule and for the British Parliament to impose a Stamp Act on the colonists in the form of </p>
<blockquote><p>“a tax on all printed materials that had to be paid in British pounds, not local money. The iconic colonial protest slogan “taxation without representation is tyranny” marked the surge of rebellion against British control but it did not tell the whole story, considering what the tax was for: to pay the cost of housing, feeding, and transporting soldiers to contain and suppress the colonies from expanding further into Indian territory (31).” </p></blockquote>
<p>The rebellion of the Anglo American settlers against British control at this point was less for independence than the objective of grabbing more land from the Native Americans. “These militant settlers—rangers—,” in the words of Dunbar-Ortiz, “created the framework for the United States to appropriate Native territories and attempt to eradicate Indigenous nations across the continent for the following century. These illegal settlers were initially dependent on colonial militias for support; after the War of Independence they relied on U.S. military to protect their settlements (32).” </p>
<p>By 1783, the British would embark on an invasion of South Asia and the Pacific, which would lead them to withdraw from the fight for sovereignty over the 13 colonies. Dunbar-Ortiz describes “Britain’s transfer of its claim to Indian Country west of the colonies” as a “nightmarish disaster for all Indigenous peoples east of the Mississippi and ultimately all of North America that would be claimed and occupied by the United States. Britain’s withdrawal in 1783 opened a new chapter of unrestrained racist violence and colonization of the continent (33).” </p>
<p>By 1785 with the creation of the United States Constitution (to be approved and implemented by all States in 1791) and the Land Ordinance that established a centralized survey and land distribution of land taken away from the Native Americans “to be auctioned off to the highest bidder,” a procedure for colonization via military occupation was already in place. The vertical and horizontal expansion of the new settler-state from North America to the Pacific was made possible by those who desired independence as inspired by pre-Revolutionary colonial elites like George Washington “who as leader of the Virginia militia took armed surveying teams illegally into Ohio country, making him one of the most successful land speculators in the colonies (38).” Dunbar-Ortiz emphasizes that “ the wealthiest colonists were all speculators” from Washington and other founders of the United States who acquired land and enslaved people (38). They “designed a governmental and economic structure to serve the private property interest of each and…nearly all of them slavers and land speculators, with the brilliant Alexander Hamilton as the genius of finance (39).” </p>
<p>The history that makes the United States’ claim to American Exceptionalism credible is a history of genocide for the accumulation of profit. The continuing brutality against black people, exploitation and oppression of immigrants, police brutality, all forms of abuse against women  and LGBTQA, imperialist resource extraction in semi-colonies, military bases expansion, the war on terror, the prison industrial complex, and gun violence are necessary to sustain the foundation of the US: “a capitalist state and an empire on conquered land, with capital in the form of slaves (39).” This continuing past, Dunbar-Ortiz notes, necessitated the founding of one of the most profitable modern corporations—the firearms industry. Thus the persistence of such history, she adds, is seen in gun proliferation and gun violence. “The Gun is patriotic. The Gun is America. The Gun is God.”</p>
<p><strong>Happiness is not a warm gun</strong></p>
<p><em>My life seems to be an increasing revelation of the intimate face of universal struggle. You begin with your family and the kids on the block, and next you open your eyes to what you call your people and that leads you into land reform and into Black English into Angola leads you back to your own bed where you lie by yourself, wondering if you deserve to be peaceful, or trusted or desired or left to the freedom of your own unfaltering heart. And the scale shrinks to the side of a skull: your own interior cage. </p>
<p>And then if you are lucky, and I have been lucky, everything comes back to you. And then you know why one of the freedom fighters in the sixties, a young Black woman interviewed shortly after she was beaten up for riding near the front of an interstate bus—you know why she said, “We are all so very happy.” </p>
<p>It’s because it’s on. All of us and me by myself: we’re on.<br />
							                                           -June Jordan, 1981</em></p>

<p>Understanding the historical context of the Second Amendment in shaping the lives and “destinies” of peoples whose personal and collective histories are entangled with the US’ rise to global hegemony is partly approaching and confronting a situation whose history has been stolen or hidden away and currently repackaged as a debate on gun rights versus gun control. The repackaging of a historical and urgent issue in this manner implies that the world can only look to either the Republicans or the Democrats for a solution. Doing so, however, is in itself part of the problem. </p>
<p>But the student activists-led massive national protest on March 24 was a big step in the right direction. True, there was a particular call for gun control immediately after the mass shooting at Parkland, Florida and even during the massive protest. Is gun regulation worse than the all too rampant killings of school children by almost always armed white males, the non-stop murder of black people by the police vis a vis the NRA’s political influence and the government’s refusal to take immediate steps? Gun regulation, though, cannot be the only idea. When cynics say it is a solution easier legislated than implemented, perhaps they mean what we already know and tolerate: impunity trumps regulation. </p>
<p>March 24 Saturday morning: In New York City subways, public announcements would facilitate the movement of bodies multiplying by the minute in the streets surrounding the Central Park. Stations near the mass up area are no longer passable for those who will join the rally. They would have to alight to stations farther away from 74th St and W Central Park. One wonders what goes on outside and is reluctantly content with making out what’s on the placards of people who are patiently queuing their way out of the subway. </p>

<p>Some say it is an event waiting to happen. But certainly, it could not have happened just by waiting. The #MarchForOurLives rally is an outcome of a brave and thoughtful organizing among the youth. They gathered together, reached out to other youths, organizations, institutions, and eventually, the power and speed at which they were holding fast to a belief in the form of an urgent campaign compelled politicians, celebrities, and even ordinary people to share their resources and make the march for our lives happen nationwide. These young people believe in defending lives. And there is nothing more radical, more basic than organizing and politicizing for the defense of lives. </p>
<p>Here, an elderly person cheers the marchers as she holds up a placard that summons the spirit of Whitney Houston and one of the most touching truths sang by many long after she is gone: “I believe the children are our future. Teach them well and let them lead the way…” </p>
<p><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Whitney-placard-467x365.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="365" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-102650" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Whitney-placard-467x365.jpg 467w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Whitney-placard-768x600.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Whitney-placard-840x656.jpg 840w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Whitney-placard.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 467px) 100vw, 467px" /></p>
<p>But Whitney is actually singing the story of Dr. Martin Luther King and the black families in Birmingham, Alabama in their fight for civil rights. #MarchForOurLives is not the first time in the history of the United States there children and teens played a prominent role in a crusade for people’s rights. </p>
<p><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/let-the-children-march-274x365.jpg" alt="" width="274" height="365" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-102660" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/let-the-children-march-274x365.jpg 274w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/let-the-children-march.jpg 498w" sizes="(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px" /></p>
<p>The black kids cannot play in the same playground as the white kids, they were banned from their schools and water fountains. Black families planned, organized, and mobilized to fight against the discriminatory Jim Crow laws that separated blacks from whites in various spaces. It was essentially a law that designated spaces as “white only.” In May 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King led a movement of young people who fought for civil rights: “Singing the songs of freedom, one thousand strong we came.” Hundreds of children were jailed during the first day, and the incarceration and violent dispersals spilled over the next two days. But the young people soldiered on and lived up to Dr. King’s vision: “Let the children march. They will lead the way.”</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/blackkids-574x365.jpg" alt="" width="574" height="365" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-102658" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/blackkids-574x365.jpg 574w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/blackkids-768x489.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/blackkids-840x534.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px" /></p>
<p>While in jail, children were chanting, “We shall overcome!” Ain’t gonna let nobody turn me around!” “Freedom is coming!” In a powerful message to these children’s parents, Martin Luther King also captured the crucial role of the youth: “Don’t worry about your children. They are going to be all right. Don’t hold them back if they want to go to jail. For they are doing a job not only for themselves, but for all of America and for all mankind.” By July 23, segregation ordinances were withdrawn by Birmingham. On August 28, over 250,000 marched to Washington DC. Dr. In this occasion, Dr. King gave his famous I have a dream speech. By 1964 and 1965, both the Civil Rights Act  of 1964 that outlaws racial, national, sexual and religious discrimination and the Voting Rights Act ended the ban on African American’s right to vote. </p>
<p>How are the youth of today, 55 years after the Civil Rights Movement, learning to lead the way? </p>
<p>First of all, they want the world to know that they can no longer be silent until the end of gun violence. They make it clear that the protection of children is far more important than so-called gun rights.  </p>
<p><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nomoresilence-274x365.jpg" alt="" width="274" height="365" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-102655" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nomoresilence-274x365.jpg 274w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nomoresilence-630x840.jpg 630w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nomoresilence.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px" /></p>
<p>Young people, perhaps even younger than ten-years old expose the madness of a social order that protect guns at the expense of kids. They reject “thoughts and prayers” offered to fallen children, they “demand action!”  and decide that “we won’t be next!” In other words, “enough” and “choose lives.” </p>

<p>A young woman is holding a thought-provoking placard that invites a historical understanding of mass shootings: “18 century laws 21st century guns.” </p>
<p>One placard exposes how in American society, guns are easier to access than transformative and empowering education for the youth. Parents with their precious babies point to the same lamentable condition by churning out a correct instruction “Books not bullets!” In a sharp rendition of people empowerment, teachers and students recognize that education is a weapon against the prevailing order of mass murder:<br />
“Arm me with pencils not a gun!”<br />
“The only arms I want in my classroom”<br />
“Arm me with books not guns”</p>

<p>A person by the sidewalk is on board as stands astounded by the crowd. He. too, has got a demand: “The youth speak truth, hear them!”</p>

<p>A queer person who is looking so joyful to see and to be seen by the marchers holds up one of the most affirmative and reassuring expression of solidarity: “armed with a Yaaassss!”</p>

<p>In a residential building towards 64th and the Avenue of the Americas, a couple watching the march by their terrace needed to confirm what the marchers most probably needed to know: “You are democracy at work. Thank you.” That we know that the March For Our Lives rally is an exercise in democracy is not enough. It is the people’s recognition and appreciation of who we are in that march that matters more. It is like being told how the enemy is definitely stronger at this point but we are your allies, and we are many, march on! Isn’t that something every radical needs to hear once in a while?</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/democracy-at-work-487x365.jpg" alt="" width="487" height="365" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-102640" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/democracy-at-work-487x365.jpg 487w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/democracy-at-work-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/democracy-at-work-840x630.jpg 840w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/democracy-at-work.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" /></p>
<p>The indictment of the State clearly articulated in a placard, which doubles as a student’s last will and testament: “If I die in a school shooting- forget burial drop my body on the steps of the capitol.” One placard indicates how the youth is owning up to its responsibility of challenging the oligarchic state that finds expression in a literary bestseller: “Perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who have LEADERSHIP thrust upon them and to their own surprise…they wear it well J.K. Rowling.”</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JK-Rowling-487x365.jpg" alt="" width="487" height="365" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-102666" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JK-Rowling-487x365.jpg 487w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JK-Rowling-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JK-Rowling.jpg 803w" sizes="(max-width: 487px) 100vw, 487px" /></p>
<p>My favorite placard is the one that says a lot with the use of curt language: “Yes I’ve got a fucking agenda!” It sums up what I owe to myself and to the politics that brings me here to the March For Our Lives rally and to all the other places that I attend to. I do have an agenda and I share it with people who believe that “democracy is not a spectator sport.” The same people who believe that an organized and self-conscious mass movement can push for urgent reforms vis a vis fundamental changes in the system. It is a belief backed up by victorious moments in history: the Paris Commune, the Bolshevik Revolution, the revolution of the Peoples Republic of China with Mao, the revolution in Vietnam with Ho Chi Minh, the greatness and tenacity of the revolutionary people of Cuba, Venezuela, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and Palestine and the breakthroughs of the Kabataan Makabayan, which unsettled the Marcos dictatorship in the Philippines. And this is not just a romantic leap in logic. </p>

Registering Eric Garner’s last words moments before he was killed by the police in 2015, I saw a young person writing up her placard and subsequently staring at it as if to ensure the completeness of a checklist. “I cannot breathe until…” The list is a combination of particular steps for gun regulation and universal demands for our people: end to mass incarceration, health care for everybody, oligarchs be gone. </p>

<p>To see people from the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement calling for justice for the murder of Stephon Clark and all victims of police terror makes me infinitely reassured and happy. Not that I wouldn’t have marched without the BLM. But their presence never fails to make me understand the truth about the accumulation of capital through slave trade, slave breeding, the auction block, the prison industrial complex, and through all the ills generated by and inherent in racial capitalism. I think and march with BLM and I am brought home to my own people— the Lumad, the Aetas, the Moros, the oppressed fighting Filipino farmers, the armed revolutionary women of the New People’s Army for whom Duterte issued an order to his men: bullets to the vaginas of these female rebels.</p>
<p>In an anthology titled “How We Get Free: Black Feminism and the Combahee River Collective” (2017), editor Keeanga-Yamahata Taylor captures how the struggle for freedom looks like. The black women of Combahee River Collective were “continuing to analyze the roots of Black women’s oppression under capitalism and arguing for the reorganization of society based on the collective needs of the most oppressed. That is to say, if you could free the most oppressed people in society, then you would have to free everyone (2017:10).” </p>
<p>Gun control is only one of the particular demands of the March For Our Lives Movement. The demands of the marchers exceed this system. It demands a democracy of another form. Only a state that is other than itself can start working towards the realization of these demands. The ball is on us marchers whose demands do not only promise but necessitate a reorganization of society. After all, marching for our lives can only break with a social order that engages in mass murder every single day for the accumulation of capitalist profit. Marching for our lives portends to a future of a redistribution of wealth and a recognition of who and what we can become as a people who choose lives over profits. </p>

<p>This Women’s Month, demonstrations were held in three different provinces and organized by different people and groups in Canada. The message, however, is clear: End all forms of violence not just against women.</p>
<p><strong>By AUBREY MAKILAN</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em> </p>
<p>EDMONTON, Alberta – Women’s rights advocates celebrated the Women’s Month in Canada by bringing to the fore the plight of women migrant workers.</p>
<p>Protest actions were staged in three different provinces: in Edmonton, Alberta on March 3 and March 11; in Toronto, Ontario on March 3 and in Montreal, Quebec on March 8. </p>
<p>Under the theme “Women’s Dignity Lies in the Fight for the Rights of All,” advocates in Edmonton braved the 10 cm-snow deep road and the snowfall warning in effect on March 3 and held a demonstration.  After the march, the rallyists warmed up inside the Old Strathcona Performing Arts Centre where they shared food and performances, which included the One Billion Rising (OBR) dance led by Migrante-Alberta.</p>
<p>In Montreal, about 600 marchers in Montreal responded to the call “Women Rise! Unite our Forces! Smash Capitalism and Patriarchy!” and joined the demonstration organized by Women of Diverse Origins (WDO).</p>
<p>In Toronto, a 30-minute program fired up the March 3rd rally, with statements read from Gabriela-Ontario, Anakbayan-Toronto, Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) and Latin-American women. The program ended with the OBR dance, which then kick-started the march.</p>
<p>These protest actions highlighted the cases of women who became victims of abuse and violence. </p>
<p>Tina Fontaine was a 15-year-old girl from the Sagkeeng First Nation who was in the care of Manitoba Child and Family Services (CFS) when she was reported missing to the Winnipeg Police Service on July 31, 2014. Her body was found wrapped in plastic and a duvet cover and weighed down with rocks in the Red River on Aug. 17, 2014. Her death is a prominent case among the high number of Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women of Canada and the criticized child welfare services. </p>
<p>In honor of the young girl, Lyla Luciano of Migrante Youth-Alberta, sang “Light a Candle for Peace,” a song composed for Fontaine by Filipino musician and Migrante-Manitoba member Levy Abad.</p>
<p>The groups also paid tribute to the 41 girls who died in the fire while locked in a room of the youth shelter, Hogar Seguro de Asunción, in Guatemala City on March 8, 2017. In addition to allegedly being beaten and raped by staff, survivors reported that their friends had also been forced into prostitution. A minute of silence was observed in memory of all these women.</p>

<p>In Montreal, “women workers, migrants, students, came out because they are fed up with sexual harassment and sexist policies, racism and the impoverishment of women and families; students came to protest against the unpaid internships they have to perform in traditionally female professions; we demanded the $15 minimum wage now,” said the WDO statement.</p>
<p>The Montreal demonstration also heard women from around the world talk about struggles in war-torn countries, such as the Israeli apartheid and the Kurdish women struggle for the survival and liberation of their people, while the singing of the folk song “Arirang” in Edmonton called for the reunification of the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Migrante-Alberta remembered women overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) whose deaths reflect the most detestable consequence of the Philippine government’s labor export policy and neglect of modern-day heroes. </p>
<p>In February, domestic worker Joanna Demafelis’ body was found inside a freezer after over a year in an abandoned apartment in Kuwait. In Kuwait alone, there have been 196 cases of OFW deaths since 2016, according to the Philippines’ Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA). Of the 196 cases, 22 were reportedly due to suicide.</p>
<p>Migrante-Alberta said that more than half of the 6,000 OFWs who get deployed out of the Philippines to work abroad are women. “Everyday, the price of finding work abroad is paid by their sweat, life and blood.”</p>
<p>One of them whose fate is still uncertain is Mary Jane Veloso, 33, currently on death row in Indonesia since 2015 for drug trafficking. Indonesian President Joko Widodo gave Veloso reprieve from a death sentence in 2015 following proceedings of the illegal recruitment and human trafficking case filed against Veloso&#8217;s alleged recruiters Maria Cristina Sergio and Julius Lacanilao. However, Anakbayan-Toronto said it is no less than the Philippine Court of Appeals that is failing Veloso after it denied her request to provide a recorded testimony in the case against her recruiters.</p>
<p>In Canada, caregivers, who are mostly women, are now facing economic uncertainty. The federal government has recently declared review of its five-year revised caregiver program, sending a wave of anxiety to those who have yet to secure permanent status before it’s end on Nov. 29, 2019. Despite this, the Alberta Caregivers Association (ACA), a new member-group of Migrante-Alberta, said that “caregivers deserve to be treated with dignity” as they care for the very foundation of Canadian society, the Canadian families. </p>
<p>“Caregiving is real work, it’s useful, it’s important, and caregivers deserve real workers’ rights.”</p>
<p>ACA recognizes the need to bring together issues of low wages, employer abuse, tied work permits, permanent residency backlog and family reunification. </p>
<p><strong>Tribute</strong></p>
<p>At the same time, the groups also celebrated women’s heroism.</p>
<p>The Filipino groups in Toronto marched under the name “The Pet Cleto Contingent.” Cleto, who passed away in January, was a Filipino immigrant who dedicated her life to the cause of migrant workers, women&#8217;s liberation and the fight against imperialism.</p>
<p>In Montreal, Women of Diverse Origins (WDO) led the tribute to some of the inspiring women who died last year: Abby Lippman, professor and activist, WDO member; (Petronila) Cleto, journalist and activist from Gabriela-Ontario and; Asma Jahangir, a Pakistani lawyer and human rights activist known for her commitment to the most oppressed. </p>
<figure id="attachment_102598" style="width: 980px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Toronto-byAnakbayan.jpg"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Toronto-byAnakbayan.jpg" alt="" width="980" height="677" class="size-full wp-image-102598" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Toronto-byAnakbayan.jpg 980w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Toronto-byAnakbayan-528x365.jpg 528w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Toronto-byAnakbayan-768x531.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Toronto-byAnakbayan-840x580.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Filipinos join the protest action in Toronto, Canada to demand justice for all caregivers who became victims of abuse.

<p>WDO spokespersons Jasmin de la Calzada and Marie-Claude Manga acknowledged the Mohawk Nation for hosting the rally on their unceeded aboriginal territory. The gathering place, Place du 6-décembre-1989, also bears significance as it was declared a memorial site for the 14 young women murdered by a misogynist during the massacre at École Polytechnique de Montréal in 1989. Among the performers were Béa Di Vinci, a Filipino-American rapper who performed a spoken word denouncing the systemic violence against aboriginal women and girls in Canada.</p>
<p>The WDO salutes the courage of women who have denounced the assaults and harassment they have experienced from men in power and the #MeToo# campaign. And to those women who have not been able to denounce the assaults they have suffered because it is too dangerous for them, they are fleeing the war, or their rights are not recognized, “we want to demolish the systems that allow these power relations and the patriarchy to persist, so that no woman has to worry about losing her job, her reputation or her life to live with respect and dignity,” said the WDO.</p>
<p><strong>Duterte’s misogyny condemned</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in the Philippines, Migrante-Alberta said, Duterte’s recent order to the military to shoot women guerrillas in their vaginas to render them &#8220;useless&#8221; is “a brazen show of disrespect and violence against women in general.” </p>
<p>When it’s the person in the highest office who “personifies misogyny by the language he uses to publicly harass, berate, mock and humiliate women, Migrante-British Columbia’s (BC) Women’s Organizing Committee said “it sets the tone in the Philippines, encouraging the local law enforcement and the military to follow suit.</p>
<p>Migrante-Alberta added that “it is a shame that it is no less than the government of the Philippines that does not implement International Humanitarian Law and instead encourages sexual violence and war crimes.” The group said they will they will join the fight “even against the most disrespectful and despotic leaders of the world.”</p>
<p>While the struggles of each women&#8217;s group are respected, WDO said the people “must build a strong movement and unite against the common enemy – patriarchy and the capitalist system.”</p>
<p>Gabriela-Ontario said, “As Filipino people, we join our Filipino sisters and the rest of our people in opposing the fascism and tyranny of the US-Duterte regime. As part of the Filipino diaspora, we pay particular attention to our migrant sisters and step up our efforts to assert our rights in the face of neoliberal policies which treat migrant workers as cheap, disposable labor.’</p>
<p>Migrante-BC agreed that while their ties with the home country are always strong and always warm as Filipino-Canadian women overseas, “we forge strong the women’s anti-imperialist solidarity with other women” as women overseas. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a>  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The city of Afrin has already fallen.</p>
<p><strong>By VIJAY PRASHAD</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.alternet.org/world/turkey-intervention-syria">AlterNet</a></p>
<p>Beirut—By mid-March, Turkish forces, alongside the remnants of the Free Syrian Army, entered the northern Syrian town of Afrin. Fifty-eight days into the siege of this city, the Syrian Kurdish forces were routed. They decided to end their defense of the city and instead turn their fighting units toward a long process of guerrilla warfare. Turkey’s president Recip Tayyib Erdogan had a triumphant air at a commemoration ceremony for the Gallipoli Campaign during World War I in the northwestern province of Canakkale. &#8220;The terror corridor has been broken,&#8221; said Erdogan.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/unnamed.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="240" class="alignright size-full wp-image-102566" /></p>
<p>The phrase &#8220;terror corridor&#8221; has become part of the vocabulary of the Turkish government. What it refers to is the slice of land that had been taken by the Syrian Kurdish forces that runs along Syria’s northern border with Turkey. The Syrian Kurdish political authorities had come to call this territory the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria. But this formal name was not the common one. It has been known as Rojava, or western Kurdistan. It is this name that bothers the Turkish government, since it harkens to a fuller Kurdish state that would include eastern Kurdistan (in Iraq and Iran) as well as northern Kurdistan (in Turkey). Turkey has been fundamentally opposed to any such Kurdish state. Even a hint of it has earned the wrath of Ankara, Turkey’s capital. It is far more useful for the Turkish government to call the belt a &#8220;terror corridor&#8221; than either a &#8220;democratic federation&#8221; or a province of a future Kurdish state. The language of the &#8220;war on terror&#8221; defines the Turkish intervention in Syria.</p>
<p><strong>Erdogan’s Miscalculation</strong></p>
<p>In 2011, Turkey’s government decided to give its full support to the rebellion against the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad. Erdogan was one of the first regional leaders to publicly call for the removal of Assad—&#8221;Assad must go&#8221; became the familiar formula. Turkey opened its borders to the rebels, allowing them to move supplies and fighters into Syria. It allowed a Syrian political opposition group to take up residence in Istanbul and it gave this platform—mainly composed of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood—full political support and encouragement. Tens of thousands of refugees from Syria streamed into Syria. Gulf Arab and Western intelligence agencies began to operate from southern Syria to help shape the war against Assad.</p>
<p>Turkey’s Erdogan miscalculated. The entry of Iranian and Russian armed power as well as the resilience of the Assad government allowed it to withstand the full force of the Gulf Arab and Western intervention through a range of fighters. Turkey produced its own militia group (Ahrar al-Sham) and provided logistical support to sections of the Free Syrian Army. Neither of Turkey’s armed groups was able to prevail. They were outflanked by the arrival of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) from Iraq and by the al-Qaeda franchise, Jabhat al-Nusra. Without U.S. airpower against Damascus, it was clear that the various proxy groups of the Gulf Arabs, Turkey and the West would not succeed.</p>
<p><strong>Syrian Democratic Forces</strong></p>
<p>A weakened Syrian state allowed the Syrian Kurds who largely live along the Syria-Turkey border to create their own political formations—the Kurdish Supreme Council—and their own armed wing—the People’s Protection Units (YPG). It was not easy for the YPG to carve out the region known as Rojava. ISIS seized Kobane in 2014, while the Turkish government intervened through Operation Euphrates Shield in 2016-17. The expansion of ISIS and the entry of the Turkish army suggested that the Syrian Kurds would not be allowed to easily establish their homeland in the north.</p>
<p>The Syrian Kurdish leadership realized that it would not be better to create a Syrian rather than a Syrian Kurdish outfit. For that reason, the Syrian Kurdish leadership created a new political platform and a new militia group—the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). They reached out to Damascus and to the Russian government, seeking to assure them that its ambitions were only to demonstrate that Syria could be a federation and that the northern province would merely be an autonomous part of a future democratic and federated Syria. This did not convince the Turks, who seemed sure that the talk of federation was a smokescreen for the establishment of an outpost of a future Kurdish state.</p>
<p>When the United States sought an ally on the ground in the fight against ISIS, Washington’s generals settled upon the Syrian Democratic Forces. It was the SDF, with close air cover from the United States, that fought tenaciously against ISIS in northern Syria. Officials in Washington and in Damascus agree that without the SDF, it would have been much more difficult to defeat ISIS in northern Syria and to free Raqqa from ISIS hands.</p>
<p>It is a sign of the complexity of this war in Syria that the Syrian Kurds would provide their fighters to defeat ISIS under the cover of U.S. warplanes. The United States, which is an ally of Turkey through NATO, used its airplanes to strengthen the position of the Syrian Kurds in northern Syria. The Assad government allowed this to occur because it had little choice and because it perhaps recognized that this put Turkey into a bind. The Syrian Kurdish position would never be able to be sustained. There is no powerful country—neither the U.S. nor Russia—that would protect the Syrian Kurds once they had created Rojava. Betrayal of the Kurds, whether in Iraq or in Syria, is a hallmark of contemporary West Asian history.</p>
<p><strong>Destruction</strong></p>
<p>The Turkish army and its Free Syrian Army allies have already begun a campaign within Afrin to destroy the emblems of Syrian Kurdish rule. Kurdish statues have been destroyed and Kurdish political figures have been arrested. It is clear that the Turkish army has been given free rein to attack the confidence of the Syrian Kurdish population. It seeks to send a symbol across Rojava that the Turkish government will not stand for any kind of Kurdish independence along its borders.</p>
<p>There was no sign from the United States that it would help its Syrian Kurdish allies. No pressure was put on the Turkish government and no U.S. aircraft flew over Afrin to protect it from superior Turkish firepower. In Astana (Kazakhstan), before the final assault on Afrin, Turkey, Russia and Iran met to acknowledge some realities. Turkey would be allowed to take Afrin and defeat the Syrian Kurdish forces. The Syrian Army, which sat outside Afrin, did not intervene to protect this Syrian city from the Turkish intervention. Meanwhile, as part of the deal, Turkey has promised not to intervene when the Syrian Army—with Russian and Iranian support—will move into Idlib in northern Syria. When the Syrian army has come close to defeating rebel groups across the country, it has allowed fighters to leave as long as they go to Idlib. It is this city that will be one of the main last fights of this war on Syria. It is now clear that Turkey will not intervene to protect the rebels in Idlib. It is the price that the Turks are now willing to pay to ensure that the Syrian Kurds lose their Rojava.</p>
<p>Bravery led Othman Sheikh Issa, co-chair of the Afrin Executive Council to say, &#8220;Our forces all over Afrin will become a constant nightmare&#8221; for the Turkish army. The Syrian Kurdish leaders had ordered their fighters to leave the city and begin guerrilla operations. But this order was disobeyed by a section of fighters who tried to hold the city. They recognized that the fall of Afrin is more than a blow to their ambitions. It might very well set back the Syrian Kurdish political cause back by a generation.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By ISIDOROS KARDERINIS</strong></p>
<p>The German elections of September 24th, 2017, due to the country’s specific political, financial and historical strength, have undoubtedly been at the center of international and European interest. Their results were marked by the winning of the Christian Union CDU / CSU led by Chancellor Angela Merkel, even with a lower percent, -33%, while in the Federal elections of 2013 it obtained 41, 5% -, the contraction &#8211; 20, 5% from 25.7% in 2013 – of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) of Martin Schulz, but also by the entry in the Federal Parliament of the AfD party, the most dangerous far- right one in Europe, due to the size of Germany and to the dramatic historical events that changed the course of the 20th century. </p>
<p>Germans, &#8211; it is more than obvious-, are grateful to Chancellor Merkel for their well-being, their high standard of living compared with that of other European peoples, for combating unemployment effectively, (the unemployment rate is at historically low levels, ie only 3.9% of the workforce) and of course for  the budget surpluses. So, for all these reasons, they gave her a fourth term in the Chancellery, something succeeded only by Konrad Adenauer, the reformer of postwar Germany and Helmut Kohl, the father of the reunification of Germany. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/german-flag.jpg"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/german-flag.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" class="alignright size-full wp-image-99913" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/german-flag.jpg 500w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/german-flag-365x365.jpg 365w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/german-flag-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/german-flag-90x90.jpg 90w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/german-flag-64x64.jpg 64w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>On the other side, Chancellor Merkel’s victory and the formation of a government with potential partners -whoever they may be- obviously implies the continuation of the policy of extreme austerity and faithful implementation of the &#8220;sacred&#8221; rules of budgetary discipline, since it serves Germany in a very visible way. However, the implementation of this policy for years now, has already strained and overstretched the Southern European countries and especially Greece and therefore, along the road, it will lead,- with mathematical precision- the entire European project  to a serious risk of collapse. </p>
<p>At the same time the historically high percent &#8211; 12.6% &#8211; of the far-right xenophobic and anti-immigrant AfD, which for the first time achieved not only to enter the Bundestag but also to become the third largest party in Germany as a whole and the second largest one in the eastern federal states, is a particularly obscure imprint of the German elections and considerably enhances the right-wing populists and extremists across the continent. It is the first time after the Second World War and the collapse of the Nazi regime in 1945 that such a thing happens, a fact that undoubtedly constitutes a negative milestone in German history. </p>
<p>At this point it should be noted that in the elections of September 2013, the party “Alternative for Germany” (AfD), which was born in the same year from the reaction of a part of the Germans against the Southern European countries, took a 4.7% percent of the votes and did not enter the Parliament. However, with its current entry, the hardcore far-right and xenophobic members of AfD, -for many people considered authentic heirs of the Nazis-, are bound to exert strong pressure on Chancellor Merkel to change the liberal democratic face she showed on immigration, terrorism and security matters, -for example the open borders policy which resulted to the entry of many refugees and migrants in Germany in September 2015. Of course, in reality, this policy is not motivated by philanthropic feelings  but it is based on Germany&#8217;s interest, as every year the country needs half a million immigrants in order to continue its existence as an economic power and in order to effectively support its social system. </p>
<p>The statement made by the co -chairman of AfD party Frauke Petry during a speech in Stuttgart, where she compared a society incorporating migrants to a “compost heap”, her approach on surveillance of the border by German guards who will shoot any refugee or immigrant attempting to pass illegally, but also the statement of the other co-chairman of AfD Alexander Gauland a few days before the 2016 Euro regarding the great black German-Ghanaian player of Bayern and of the German National Football Team Jerome Boateng, -“People consider him a good player, but they would not want him as their neighbor”- indicate in the clearest way that this party has indeed inherited the loathsome traditions of  the assault battalions of the National Socialist German Workers’ Party of Adolf Hitler in the decade of 1930, regarding the Aryan race. </p>
<p>What is the reason, however, of the frantic rise of this racist political formation who wants among other things to change the attitude of Germany in order to stop the manifestation of remorse for the horrible Nazi crimes? Definitely a key cause is the refugee and migration crisis which nowadays has assumed gigantic proportions and which overstretches the European countries and of course Germany. On this ground of the ongoing refugee and migration flows, instead of the building by the developed world of a democratic and progressive refugee and immigration policy showing compassion and solidarity, the spiky flowers of evil grow, and inhuman, fascist policies and hatred rhetoric emerge triumphant against persecuted and unfortunate people who fled their homes under the most tragic circumstances seeking light far from the horrible, deadly darkness of war and extreme poverty, and hope for a better and more peaceful future.</p>
<p>Moreover, another important reason for the rapid rise of the far-right AfD is the full use -by the officials of this political formation- of the Islamic terrorist incidents and of the criminal events who connect them to the influx of refugees and immigrants from Islamic countries. So, during the election period, they did not fail to remind the massacre in the Christmas market in Berlin and the sexual attacks against young German women by Arab immigrants in the New Year 2016 in Cologne. </p>
<p>Finally, the seed of the extreme and xenophobic views is much better incubated as the new &#8220;snake egg&#8221; in the prosperous societies of the North that feel threatened by the &#8220;poor people&#8221; of the South, -to whom they have attributed various negative stereotypes-, and of course, by the refugees and the immigrants.<br />
In conclusion, the imprints of the German elections are obscure for both the poorer Southern Europe countries in difficulty, -since the German policy of austerity is not going to change not even a little- and for the democratic citizens of Germany and of the whole Europe who watch with horror the nightmarish onslaught of the fascist, racist and xenophobic political entities.</p>

The US bombing campaign is now the heaviest, nearly triple in amount of dropped bombs in Iraq and Syria alone, since the bombing of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos in the 60s to 70s.</p>
<p><strong>by NICOLAS J S DAVIES</strong><br />
<a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2017/07/10/the-u-s-state-of-war-july-2017/">Counterpunch</a></p>
<p>This is the state of war in the United States in July 2017.</p>
<p>The US bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is now the heaviest since the bombing of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos in the 1960s-70s, with<a href="http://www.afcent.af.mil/Portals/82/Documents/Airpower%20summary/Airpower%20Summary%20-%20May%202017_Final.pdf?ver=2017-06-08-084015-140"> 84,000 bombs and missiles</a> dropped between 2014 and the end of May 2017.  That is nearly triple the <a href="http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2003/uscentaf_oif_report_30apr2003.pdf">29,200 bombs and missiles dropped on Iraq </a>in the “Shock and Awe” campaign of 2003.</p>
<p>The Obama administration escalated the bombing campaign last October, as the U.S.-Iraqi assault on Mosul began, dropping 12,290 bombs and missiles between October and the end of January when President Obama left office.  The Trump administration has further escalated the campaign, dropping another 14,965 bombs and missiles since February 1st.  May saw the heaviest bombing yet, with 4,374 bombs and missiles dropped.</p>
<p>The U.K.-based Airwars.org monitoring group has compiled reports of between <a href="https://airwars.org/civilian-casualty-claims/">12,000 and 18,000 civilians killed</a> by nearly three years of U.S.-led bombing in Iraq and Syria.  These reports can only be the tip of the iceberg, and the true number of civilians killed could well be more than 100,000, based on typical ratios between reported deaths and actual deaths in previous war zones.</p>
<p>As the U.S. and its allies closed in on Mosul in Iraq and Raqqa in Syria, and as U.S. forces now occupy <a href="http://21stcenturywire.com/2017/07/05/us-expands-military-footprint-in-syria-to-eight-bases-modifies-kobani-air-base/">eight military bases in Syria</a>, Islamic State and its allies have struck back in Manchester and London; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marawi_crisis">occupied Marawi</a>, a city of 200,000 in the Philippines; and exploded a huge truck bomb inside the fortifications of the “Green Zone” in Kabul, Afghanistan.<br />
<img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/bloodonhands.jpg" alt="US War" width="175" height="262" class="alignright size-full wp-image-98213" /><br />
What began in 2001 as <a href="http://benferencz.org/2000-2004.html#crimesagainsthumanity">a misdirected use of military force </a>to punish a group of formerly U.S.-backed jihadis in Afghanistan for the crimes of September 11th has escalated into a global asymmetric war.  Every country destroyed or destabilized by U.S. military action is now a breeding ground for terrorism.  It would be foolish to believe that this cannot get much, much worse, as long as both sides continue to justify their own escalations of violence as responses to the violence of their enemies, instead of trying to deescalate the now global violence and chaos.</p>
<p>There are once again 10,000 US troops in Afghanistan, up from 8,500 in April, with reports that four thousand more may be deployed soon.  Hundreds of thousands of <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2016/01/17/playing-games-with-war-deaths/">Afghans have been killed</a> in 15 years of war, but the Taliban now control more of the country than at any time since the U.S. invasion in 2001.</p>
<p>The US is giving vital support to the Saudi-led war in Yemen, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/10/03/us-warships-sent-to-area-where-iran-backed-rebels-attacked-saudi-led-coalition-ship.html">supporting a blockade </a>of Yemeni ports and providing intelligence and in-air refueling to the Saudi and allied warplanes that have been bombing Yemen since 2015.  UN reports of <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/yemen-civil-war-civilian-death-toll-10000-killed-40000-injured-conflcit-un-reveals-a7530836.html">10,000 civilians killed </a>are surely only a fraction of the true numbers killed, and thousands more have died from disease and hunger.</p>
<p>Now Yemen is facing a humanitarian crisis and a raging cholera epidemic due to lack of clean water or medicine caused by the bombing and the blockade. The UN is warning that millions of Yemenis could die of famine and disease.  A Senate bill to restrict some U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia was defeated by 53 votes (48 Republicans and 5 Democrats) to 47 in June.</p>
<p>Closer to home, U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) recently hosted a conference with the presidents of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador in Miami.  This signaled a further militarization of the U.S. war on drugs in Central America and efforts to limit immigration from those countries, even as a report by State and Justice Department inspector generals held <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/05/24/dea-lied-to-congress-about-deadly-raid-that-killed-four-hondurans-government-report-says/">State Department and Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) </a>agents responsible for the killing of four innocent civilians (one man, two women and a 14-year-old boy) by machine-gun fire from a State Department helicopter near Ahuas in Honduras in 2012.</p>
<p>The inspector generals’ report found that DEA officials repeatedly lied to Congress about this incident, pretending the Hondurans were killed in a shoot-out with drug traffickers, raising serious doubts about accountability for escalating U.S. paramilitary operations in Central America.</p>
<p>Right-wing opposition protests in Venezuela have turned more violent, with 99 people killed since April, as the protests have failed to mobilize enough popular support to topple the leftist government of Nicolas Maduro.  The <a href="http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/US-Has-Budgeted-49M-for-Venezuelan-Right-Wing-Since-2009-20170517-0018.html">U.S. supports the opposition</a> and has led diplomatic efforts to force the government to resign, so there is a danger that this could escalate into a US-backed civil war.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Colombia, <a href="http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/First-Colombia-FARC-Group-Disarms-Peace-Deal-Moves-Forward-as-Violence-Continues-UN-20170512-0016.html">right-wing death squads </a>are once again operating in areas where the FARC has disarmed, killing and threatening people to drive them off land coveted by wealthy landowners.</p>
<p>Looming over our increasingly war-torn world are renewed U.S. threats of military action against North Korea and Iran, both of which have more robust defenses than any that U.S. forces have encountered since the American War in Vietnam.  Rising tensions with Russia and China risk even greater, even existential dangers, as symbolized by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Doomsday Clock, whose hands now stand at 2-1/2 minutes to midnight.</p>
<p>Although our post-9/11 wars have probably killed <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/06/05/will-the-neocons-long-war-ever-end/">at least 2 million people</a> in the countries we have attacked, occupied or destabilized, U.S. forces have suffered historically low numbers of casualties in these operations.  There is a real danger that this has given U.S. political and military leaders, and to some extent the American public, a false sense of the scale of U.S. casualties and other serious consequences we should look forward to as our leaders escalate our current wars, issue new threats against Iran and North Korea, and stoke rising tensions with Russia and China.</p>
<p>This is the state of war in the United States in July 2017. </p>
