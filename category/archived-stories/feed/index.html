				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>From NATIONAL UNION OF JOURNALISTS OF THE PHILIPPINES (NUJP)</strong><br />
<em>September 8, 2010</em></p>
<p>The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines joins the family, friends, colleagues and the media industry in mourning the passing of Alexander Martin Remollino.</p>
<p>Alex was only 33 when he died.</p>
<p>But in his short life, Alex made a lasting mark in Philippine journalism.</p>
<p>He was more than a chronicler of the travails of Juan de la Cruz. He cast away the conventions of Western journalism that, in their blandness often serve the status quo, and fiercely embraced the dictum that his craft existed to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable.</p>
<p>He rarely wasted his talent on reporting the oftentimes hopeless and useless antics of so-called leaders whose only qualifications are being born to wealth and privilege except to unmask the venality and banality that passes for governance in this benighted land.</p>
<p>With admirable skill and compassion, he documented in a language that was passionate and eloquent, yet easily readable, the sufferings and triumphs, the sorrows and joys, the shattered dreams and hopes of our long-suffering people.</p>
<p>Alexander Martin Remollino was more than a journalist. He was a Filipino journalist. Not by mere virtue of birth but because he truly devoted his craft to and for his audience, the Filipino people.</p>
<p>Mabuhay ka, Alex!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By LYN V. RAMO</strong><br />
 <em> <a href="http://www.bulatlat.com/">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>LEGAZPI CITY &#8212; The tribal leader said he lives nearby.  Speaking in Tagalog, he said, “<em>Diyan lang</em> (nearby),” when asked where he would go home to.  </p>
<p>To indigenous peoples, the phrase “<em>Diyan lang</em>,” is as simple as pointing to the back with a hand over their shoulder.  Without clarifying further, the “<em>bagong salta</em>” (newcomers) might be in for a long walk over the rugged mountain terrain they have never trekked before.</p>
<p>Indigenous peoples are used to walking long hours, their stamina not even challenged, partly because they are used to it, and partly because they are healthy enough to face the hardships owing to the nature of their communities.  This explains the phrase “<em>Diyan lang</em>,” which may refer to a distance that would take the &#8220;bagong salta&#8221; three days to reach. </p>
<p>They said they did not choose to live a poverty-stricken life.  They are not bound to suffer as they have been living in mineral-rich and nature-bountiful lands their forefathers have nurtured for generations. The mountains used to give them precious metals such as gold, silver, copper, nickel and many more.  The rivers used to teem with fish and other marine resources.  The plains gave them the needed cereals, meat and vegetables.</p>
<p>Their forefathers used to enjoy the richness of their ancestral territories, until the “bagong salta” brandishing a piece of paper, told them to leave because machineries would come and build school houses and roads, not just for the “natives,” but for national development.  </p>
<p>Tiwi has also lost its hot springs to the geothermal plant, which now produces 289 mega-watts (MW) of electricity contributing some eight percent for the Luzon grid.  Tiwi geothermal field is one of only two commercially operating geothermal plants in the country. The other, producing 459 MW, is Makiling-Banahaw geothermal field in Laguna and Batangas provinces.  </p>
<p>Renewable energy could be the answer to global warming because it does not produce much greenhouse gases.  </p>
<p>The Agtas of Tiwi, Albay are not exempt from this reality, although their counterparts in other areas in the Philippines are not luckier than them either.   They headed farther into the mountains and now live in narrow valleys, where they could still ask their gods to control the wind and the rains.    </p>
<p>That is the way with indigenous peoples.  Their belief systems make them resilient to even the worst impacts of climate change.  When they do not see any rain and their crops wither, they perform rituals that would invoke for rains and the cooling down of the temperature.</p>
<p>“We talk to nature through  our gods to help us talk to the rain and wind,” the tribal chieftain said in Filipino.  He was referring to the rituals they perform from time to time but mostly twice a year depending on the need.</p>
<p>The Agtas see climate change and global warming as nature’s way of punishing those who have violated it.  As one Agta teacher would say,   “Climate change is nature’s whip because it has been violated.”</p>
<p>To remedy this, the tribal leaders offer prayers and ask for forgiveness in behalf of the erring people.  They invoke for the resumption of good weather.  </p>
<p>“The holding of the ritual is the responsibility of the whole community. It is not just of the persons performing the rituals, according to Roland Atanacio,26, a teacher from sitio (subvilllage) Altong in Misibis.   </p>
<p>There was one ritual, which the Agta performed in Cagsawa, near the belfry ruins, with Lumad peoples of Mindanao.  One of the Lumads reportedly saw in a vision, that Mayon Volcano would erupt.  Lumad leaders then coordinated with the Agta to perform the ritual, where the “Kingdom of the unseen” was claimed to be in the vicinity of the Cagsawa ruins.   </p>
<p>The Agtas of Tiwi, Albay are further subdivided into the Coron, Agta-Cimarron and Agta-Tabangnon.  They make up 272 families who now reside in sitios Joraan, Misibis and Malem. </p>
<p>They live tending abaca and processing the stalks into semi-finished fiber, which they sell at P25 per kilo.  They harvest abaca once in five to eight months, when there is enough sunlight to dry the fiber. </p>
<p>They also plant root crops, which is their staple and scour the mountain for anything that feeds them.  </p>
<p>They till the slopes of mountain sides and plant these with whatever that sustains life.  “Anything in the mountains that sustain life,” as they refer to food crops and wildlife.</p>
<p>The Agtas inspired Tiwi Mayor Jaime C. Villanueva to support a program on education that would promote Perma-culture (short for permanent agriculture) at the Tiwi Agro-industrial School.</p>
<p>Perma-culture is nature-based organic, agro-forestry, according to Vilanueva in an interview in his office during the Coron Festival on August 6. </p>
<p>Living with nature, like the way indigenous peoples live, is the best way to combat climate change and global warming.   There is less input in agriculture and fisheries and the result is sustainable, according to Villanueva. “We can live in the way of nature,” he told the members of the Philippine Network of Environmental Journalists (PNEJ).  </p>
<p>The Agtas of Tiwi are among 14 million indigenous peoples all over the country.  The lure of urban living and development aggression into their indigenous abode and ancestral territories have driven many indigenous peoples from their ancestral lands.</p>
<p>Like the Igorots of the Cordillera who have to give way to projects such as large dams and mining in the name of national interest, the Agtas and their counterparts in other parts of the country have to make do with little government attention to their plight, decline in agricultural produce and a dwindling natural resource, which may, or may not, be a result of global warming and climate change. </p>
<p>It was past 2:00 p.m. when the group of journalists belonging to PNEJ arrived in the place where the indigenous Agta leaders would meet the entourage.  Because the leader insinuated he lives just a short distance, the talks went on longer than what the journalists and their hosts in the provincial government of Albay had expected.</p>
<p>It was already dark when the PNEJ convoy reached the next stop: organic farm.  They wished there was another day to see other sustainable projects like the marine sanctuary and the mangrove reforestation.  </p>
<p>On the way home, the visiting journalists could not help but wonder how many more kilometers do the Agta leaers have to walk to get home to their respective communities in the bosom of Tiwi’s Mount Malinao.  Do most of them have food on the table when they get home, knowing that they have spent the whole day preparing to meet the “bagong salta”</p>
<p>For the Agtas of Tiwi, the phrase “Diyan lang,” must be referring to the road to their liberation as indigenous peoples.  It is a long and winding road that may be shortened depending on how one sees development. As they always say, it is just there.  <em> <a href="http://www.bulatlat.com/" style="font-weight: bold"> (Bulatlat.com)</a></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>BY BENJIE OLIVEROS<br />
 <em> <a href="http://www.bulatlat.com/">Bulatlat.com</a></em></strong></p>
<p>The last time the country underwent the same type of changes in the charter, currently being pushed by the Arroyo administration, purportedly to solve the political and economic crisis was in 1972. Marcos presided over the finalization of the 1971 Constitution, which shifted the form of government from presidential to parliamentary. But the 1971 Constitution and the laws and measures enacted by Marcos, which is being emulated by the Arroyo administration, did not solve the political and economic crisis confronting the country, it worsened it.  </p>
<p>The debate regarding charter change (Cha Cha) is shifting into high gear.  No thanks to the efforts of the Arroyo administration in trying to ram its version of Cha Cha. With no hope of getting the support of Senate for charter change through a constituent assembly and with their moves to force the issue by having the Lower House vote to overrule the Senate standing on shaky constitutional and legal grounds, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and her supporters in the House of Representatives is now trying another track, through a people’s initiative. </p>
<p>The administration is desperately trying to gather 5.6 million signatures nationwide.  Even as the Supreme Court had already ruled in 1997 that Republic Act 6735, the Initiative and Referendum Act of 1989, is inadequate without an enabling law, the administration is still pushing for the gathering of signatures in another effort to force the issue.  They are confident that when challenged before the Supreme Court, the High Court will again reverse itself, as what it did with the Mining Act of 1995, especially since the two justices who issued a dissenting opinion in 1997 continue to be senior members with one of them, Artemio Panganiban, sitting as the current chief justice.</p>
<p>The Arroyo administration claims that it had no hand in the gathering of signatures and that these were being done by the Union of Local Authorities of the Philippines (ULAP) and private groups such as Sigaw ng Bayan (People’s Clamor).  But who believes them? If the government was not involved why was it able to use the network of barangays in calling for so-called assemblies? The ULAP is headed by Bohol Gov. Erico Aumentado and its members are local officials.  They plan and undertake the gathering of signatures using their local authority, during their official time, and using the resources of local government.  How can a private group such as Sigaw ng Bayan, which suddenly appeared, develop a nation-wide network and obtain vast resources to undertake such a big campaign in so short a time?  Even the expenses for communications, materials, and human resources alone had to be huge, not to mention the money that changed hands in exchange for signatures. </p>
<p>How can the administration claim that there is this sudden surge of people clamoring for Charter Change last March 25 when only a month ago Macapagal-Arroyo had to declare a state of national emergency to keep itself in power? Is this what Aumentado calls a “true manifestation of the people’s will”?</p>
<p>This is sophism in the same league as the administration’s claims that Macapagal-Arroyo won in the 2004 elections; the persons talking in the “Hello Garci” tapes are not Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and former Commission on Elections Commissioner Virgilio Garcillano; there are no graft and corruption cases involving Macapagal-Arroyo and her family; and the administration does not condone human rights violations and the suppression of the media and the legal left. </p>
<p>The Arroyo administration says that Cha Cha will solve the political problems and crisis facing the country.  But the shift from presidential to a parliamentary form of government cannot solve the political crisis brought about by questions of legitimacy hounding the Arroyo government.  It will only give the Arroyo administration a measure to evade its ouster and the power to suppress opposition to its rule.  It will grant the combined powers of president and prime minister to Macapagal-Arroyo; and remove restrictions to the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, civil liberties and political rights, and safeguards to the declaration of martial law.</p>
<p>Cha Cha will not solve the economic problems and crisis wrecking the country and its people.  It will give foreign corporations free rein to exploit the Filipino masses and the country’s natural resources to satisfy the former’s greed for profit. </p>
<p>Cha Cha will not bring the country in line with the developed countries of the world.  It will worsen the country’s underdevelopment and make it more subservient to U.S. control and interests. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Conclusion</em></p>
<p><strong>If there’s anybody to blame for making farm life in the Ifugao town of Alfonso Lista more and more miserable today, it should be the Arroyo government for its aggressive promotion of GMO in corn production in tandem with the TNC giant Monsanto and the Ayalas, among other corporations.</p>
<p>BY FERNANDO BAGYAN AND LULU GIMENEZ<br />
Northern Dispatch</strong></p>
<p>BAGUIO CITY &#8211; The municipality of Alfonso Lista, known until recently as Potia, in Ifugao, hosts relatively young settlements founded within the last eight decades.</p>
<p>The first settlers on this remote upland town in the Cordillera region, northern Philippines were Ilocanos who were plucked by American colonial authorities in the 1920s to start an agricultural colony. The colony was to replace indigenous shifting cultivation with sedentary farming. Somewhat successful, the Ilocano farmers’ colony eventually attracted Gaddang and Ibanag from the Cagayan Valley to the east, and Kalinga from the Cordillera foothills to the north.  From the 1950s to the 1970s, Bontok, Kankanaey, and Ibaloy from the Mountain Province and Benguet, and Ifugao from the municipalities of Mayoyao, Banaue, Lagawe, and Kiangan, settled here as well, drawn by reports of a warm place with a fertile land that could yield more than the aged wet-rice terraces and over-tilled swidden sites of their cold villages in the interior Cordillera.</p>
<p>Today, nearly 65 percent of the town’s land is devoted to agriculture.  Roughly, half the agricultural land is used for crop production; the other half for pasture. Rice used to be the main produce. Now, corn occupies at least 63 percent of croplands. The only crops that are still grown in the traditional way are bananas.</p>
<p>The National Statistics Office (NSO) branch in Ifugao reports that the total population of Alfonso Lista as of 2004 was 24,151 individuals or 4,650 households. Almost all are peasant households who own the land they till under homestead patents received from government for settling in the area.</p>
<p>Modern corn breeds spread to Alfonso Lista from Isabela, where agriculture authorities promoted them through various campaigns. These included Maisan (Corn Country) 77, the Ramos government’s Medium Term Agricultural Development Program, the Estrada government’s Agrikulturang Makamasa (Agriculture for the Masses), and most recently, Macapagal-Arroyo’s Ginintuang Masaganang Ani (Golden Harvest of Plenty).</p>
<p>The breeds that first gained entry were the public varieties developed by the University of the Philippines Institute of Plant Breeding.  Soon these were replaced by corporate-developed varieties – specifically those of San Miguel Corporation, Corn World, Pioneer Hy-Brid, East-West, Cargill, Monsanto, and Syngenta.  With the seeds came the chemicals purposely designed for them.</p>
<p>From 1997 to 2000, monocrop production of corn expanded by 253 percent, and production volume rose by more than 1,000 percent. (See Table)</p>
<p><strong>Analyzing the terrain</strong></p>
<p>The use of high-input varieties in Alfonso Lista has not significantly altered the traditional, peasant pattern of land tenure in the area: almost all households here still own most of the land they till. Under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law, the old homestead patents were merely subdivided, with each lot covering at least 24 hectares.</p>
<p>Most landholdings planted to corn range from one-half to three hectares.  Some households with less than a hectare rent additional land from those with larger holdings. </p>
<p>In general, implements used by corn farmers still include the simple plow, harrow, and carabao, and traditional handheld tools. But some modern mechanical equipment have been introduced, like small tractors and row planters, backpacked sprayers, threshers and shellers. </p>
<p>Not owning any vehicle at all, most households hire truckers, paying them at a rate of P1 ($0.02, based on an exchange rate of P55.71 per U.S. dollar) for every kilo of corn transported. The dealers to whom the corn is to be delivered own some of the trucks.<br />
Use of high-input varieties like Bt corn</p>
<p>All corn-producing peasants in Alfonso Lista grow high-input varieties because they find these more productive and marketable. Some are GMOs, but the majority are simple hybrids. </p>
<p>The peasants of Alfonso Lista were introduced to genetically-engineered varieties of corn by agricultural input suppliers in Isabela who entered into dealership contracts with the corporations that developed these, the promotions personnel of those corporations and the agricultural officers of government. </p>
<p>Bt corn was brought to Isabela by Monsanto.  This was during the field trials the company conducted in the year 2000.  In 2003, Monsanto’s Dekalb Yieldgard (DK 818 YG) reached Alfonso Lista.</p>
<p>Two years later, however, Bt corn has yet to become the seed of choice in the area.  Farm operators choose it only when they are late in starting their crop, and the crop is thus more vulnerable to weather problems and pests.</p>
<p>Many peasants of Alfonso Lista avoid Bt corn because they have experienced severe itching when handling the plants in the course of crop care and during threshing; also when handling the corn grain during shelling and drying. In addition, they have heard reports from fellow corn producers that there have been cases in the neighboring municipality of Lamut of carabaos that died after eating the vegetative parts of the corn, and of cattle’s hooves being cut when trampling corn stubbles in newly harvested fields.</p>
<p>Moreover, the seeds of DK 818 YG cost about twice as much as other corn seeds (P4,650 or $83.47 vs. P2,300-P2,800 or $41.28-$50.26 per 18-kilogram sack). The herbicides required in the care of the crop are also more expensive (P1,350 vs P250 to P900 per 1-liter bottle). The Bacillus thuringensis in Bt corn transfers to any weeds surrounding the corn plots and makes these weeds just as sturdy as the corn crop. It is therefore necessary to use a very powerful herbicide that is specifically formulated to kill “Bt weeds.”</p>
<p>The peasants of Alfonso Lista are still unaware of reports that the Bacillus thuringensis protein in Bt corn can be transferred to other plants, including any food crops that they grow near their corn fields for their own households’ consumption. Neither are they aware of the findings that the antibiotic markers which allowed the Bacillus thuringensis protein to get spliced into corn DNA can significantly reduce the ability of both people and livestock who consume Bt corn grain to make use of antibiotics like Streptomycin. It is possible that if they were to be made aware of the aforesaid findings, the peasants of Alfonso Lista will become even less receptive to Bt corn than they are at present, notwithstanding the aggressive promotion of this GMO by their agricultural input suppliers, Monsanto, and government.</p>
<p>Most of the corn farmers of Alfonso Lista lack money to spend on the inputs they need and thus have to avail of credit. However, there are no credit institutions within the municipality. Both government and private agencies have tried to establish cooperatives here but those that they started went bankrupt due to mismanagement.</p>
<p>Some of the peasants get credit from the Santiago, Isabela branch of Quedancor, the Quedan and Rural Credit Guarantee Corporation that used to be attached to the DA but has been re-organized by Macapagal-Arroyo and placed directly under her office. Its main function is to provide credit for endeavors that are in line with the President’s agricultural modernization priorities.</p>
<p>Most peasants prefer to enter into a credit arrangement with one of Santiago’s agricultural input dealers. Under the deal, the creditor will provide all the inputs at an interest of 30 percent per cropping, and the debtor is obliged to sell his or her crop to the creditor even if other dealers offer higher prices.  No collateral is needed. </p>
<p>Reneging on the terms of the loan will have dire consequences, however. The debtor will be blacklisted by the creditor and lose access to future loans if the debtor is unable inability to deliver his or her harvest and pay the loan. The loan will then have to be paid at the next harvest &#8211; double the interest. Meantime, the debtor will have to take out another loan to produce the next crop that he or she must deliver.</p>
<p><strong>The government’s responsibility</strong></p>
<p>Government has played a key role in promoting modern corn breeds among the peasants of Alfonso Lista. </p>
<p>The Municipal Agricultural Office (MAO) of Alfonso Lista has conducted field trials and technology demonstrations using different corn seeds provided free by the agricultural input producing firms Monsanto (through its Philippine research partner, Ayala), Syngenta, Pioneer, Corn World, and BioSeed, plus Asian Hybrid.  In addition, the MAO has been selling these firms’ corn seeds to first-time users among Alfonso Lista’s peasants at a subsidy, for only half the prevailing market price.</p>
<p>The experiences of corn-producing peasants in Alfonso Lista underscore the negative effects of the Philippine government’s promotion of the market-oriented production of modern plant breeds through its agricultural modernization programs. </p>
<p>No such modernization is taking place, however. The programs just promote the intensive use of inputs which can only be acquired after spending so much. To access the inputs, the peasants thus need access to credit.  Nowadays, the Philippine government, through Quedancor, offers such credit, but on conditions that include the surrender of collateral in the form of landed property – a condition that peasants coming from indigenous Cordillera cultures find hard to live with. </p>
<p>Worse, in a market flooded with cheap imports, the prices of the peasants’ produce have become inelastic. Most likely, they will earn only enough for their households’ subsistence.  Most likely, they will have to again borrow money or inputs for their next harvest.</p>
<p>Not only is debt repeatedly incurred; the debt continually increases as the peasants get caught in a pattern of increasing loan-dependent input utilization.  </p>
<p>It may not have happened yet in Alfonso Lista, but in other parts of the Cordillera , peasants have also become dependent on credit for access to the most basic subsistence goods. This is particularly true along the Vegetable Belt that extends from La Trinidad in Benguet northward to Bauko in the Mountain Province and eastward to Tinoc in Ifugao. </p>
<p>Clearly, the situation in the Cordillera shows the risks that peasants face when they give up producing food for their own consumption and abandon the diversified cropping system traditional to peasant agriculture.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong> As of January 2007, the prevailing pump price of gasoline and diesel is now more than twice their price when President Gloria Arroyo took over in January 2001.</p>
<p>BY IBON Foundation<br />
Posted by <em>Bulatlat</em></strong></p>
<p>As of January 2007, the prevailing pump price of gasoline and diesel is now more than twice their price when President Gloria Arroyo took over in January 2001.</p>
<p>Compared with their respective levels before the downstream oil industry was deregulated in April 1996, the pump price of gasoline is now more than six times higher while that of diesel is more than eight times higher. In addition, the current pump price of gasoline and diesel is almost four times and five times, respectively of their price at the start of deregulation. These figures also show that 62.98 percent of the increases in the pump price of gasoline and 57.63 percent of the increases in the pump price of diesel since the oil industry was deregulated happened under the term of Arroyo. (See Table 1) </p>
<p>The Arroyo government can of course argue that the oil price increases during its watch were very steep due to developments in the world oil market that are beyond its control. But government should be held accountable because of its deregulation policy that allowed domestic oil prices to soar. Since the oil industry was deregulated, there have been at least 81 rounds of oil price hikes (OPH) for diesel or an average of more than eight OPH rounds per year compared with only one round annually before the industry was deregulated. In 2005 and 2006 alone, at least 36 rounds of OPH for diesel have been recorded. (See Table 2)</p>
<p> If only to check the uncontainable price increases of oil products, which soared tremendously during its watch, the Arroyo government should have long repealed Republic Act (RA) 8479 or the Downstream Oil Industry Deregulation Act of 1998.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it continued to implement this flawed policy while misleading the public that the solution lies in its alternative fuels program such as RA 9367 or the Biofuels Act of 2006. Such program, however, does not answer the urgent problem of frequent oil price hikes and exorbitant prices and only serves the interests of landlords and big businessmen involved in the sugar and coconut industries, including Arroyo’s own family. <strong>IBON Foundation/posted by</strong><em><a href="http://www.bulatlat.com/" style="font-weight: strong">(Bulatlat.com)</a></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>NI ROLAND TOLENTINO</strong><br />
<em> <a href="http://www.bulatlat.com/">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>Sino ang hindi nabubuhay sa fantasya sa kasalukuyang panahon?  Fantasya ng mga hubad at halos hubong babae at lalake sa panahon ng bikini at model searches.  Fantasya ng maging next big star.  Fantasya ni Darna na muli’t muling pinapapanood sa atin, ngayon naman sa telebisyon.</p>
<p>            Matatawag rin fantasya ang malling at window shopping.  Binibigyan tayo ng pasubali sa posibilidad sa mga pinakabagong damit, bag, sapatos, gadget—ang maaring makamit kung mayroon tayong sapat na salapi sa wallet.  At tunay namang abot-tanaw lang ang pangarap na napapagitnaan ng salamin—ang kakulangan sa mamimili at ang tagapamatid-kulang na bagay.</p>
<p>            Sa pagtindi ng krisis pang-ekonomiya at pangkabuhayan, sino ang ayaw maniwalang maililigtas tayo ni Darna, o kahit na sa kapangitan ng pabalat ay ginintuan pa rin ang puso ng Kampanerang Kuba?  O sa pagtayo ng pinakabagong exklusibong mall sa Cubao—ang Gateway—sa pagitan ng dalawang mass rail transit lines ang siyang karugtong ng pangarap na maging First World?</p>
<p>            Sa isang banda, mahalaga ang fantasya dahil ito ang nagiging paraan ng negosiasyon sa paghihirap ng buhay.  Sino ang hindi nangarap magkaroon ng superpowers para malampasan ang kawalan-katarungan sa sarili o para maisalba ang mahal sa buhay sa kumunoy ng paghihirap?</p>
<p>            Sa kabilang banda, ang hindi produktibo sa fantasya ay ang pagiging kabahagi rin nito ng mismong mga institusyong pagbibigay-lagusan sa fantasya bilang solusyon sa problema.  Binebentahan tayo, halimbawa, ng ABS-CBN ng pangarap na pwede tayong mag-artista o maging sikat na singer, pati boxingero, kapag nagpursigi tayo sa ating mga pangarap.</p>
<p>            Sila na nagbebenta ng pangarap natin ay sila rin naman na nagpapangarap sa atin.  Mayroon bang magkakaroon ng lehitimong interes na maging boxingero via reality search kung may oportunidad naman sa mga larangan ng palakasan? </p>
<p>            Sa kadalasan pa nga, sa malawakang korapsyon sa bansa, ang mga institusyon din ang nagnanakaw ng pangarap ng sambayanan.  Hindi nga ba’t sa pagkapangulo ni Erap ay dinambong niya ang mga pangarap ng bayan sa pagnanakaw ng yaman-pambansa?  Ang mamamayan na nagpakat ng kanilang pangarap sa tagumpay ni Erap ay naiwang nakabinbin sa hangin hanggang sa may bagong panday o aparisyon ng birhen na kanilang makikita bilang katubusan ng kanilang kalagayan.</p>
<p>            Kakatwa sa titulo ng isang pelikula, “Kung mangarap ka’t magising,” walang gumigising sa pangarap.  Natatapos lamang ang pangarap para simulan ng bago.  Ang ating pagtanghod sa pang-araw-araw ay pagsasalit-salit ng mga pangarap. </p>
<p>            Nagigising lang naman talaga kapag hinaluan ng politikal ang pangarap.  Sa isang banda, ang pagtukoy sa realidad kaysa sa fantasya ang katapusan ng pangarap.  Paano ka mangangarap kung mulat ka?  Sa kabilang banda, kapag nilagyan ng politikal ang fantasya, ito ay nagiging causa na nagkakaroon ng lugar sa “cause-oriented groups” o mga organisasyon may layon ng panlipunang transformasyon. </p>
<p>            Utopia ang dulot nito.  Nagsasakripisyo ka dahil mayroon kang pangarap na maabot sa hinaharap na lampas pa sa sarili mong kabutihan.  Ang utopia ay kolektibong pangarap.  Kapag maramihan ang naniniwala at nakikipaglaban para sa paniniwala, ito ay utopia.</p>
<p>            Si Narda, isang pilay at mahirap, nangarap na mapabuti ang kanyang sariling lagay.  Pumasa siya sa isang pagsusulit ng enkantadang matanda na binigyan siya ng kapangyarihan.  Ang agimat na bato, kapag isinubo at binigkas ang kataga, ang ordinaryong si Narda ay magiging extraordinaryong si Darna.</p>
<p>            Pero kailangang isakripisyo ni Narda ang kanyang sariling interes.  Kailangan niyang tulungan ang mga higit na nangangailangan, gamitin ang kanyang kapangyarihan para sa kabutihan.  At sa dami ng natulungan ni Darna, nangarap tayong maging tulad niya—may kapangyarihan at may kapangyarihang makapanlimi sa kinakailangang gawin.</p>
<p>            Pero hindi tulad ni Darna, hindi magical ang transformasyon ng sarili.  Wala tayong boses o lakas para baguhin ang kalagayan ng sarili, lalo na ng nakararami.  Tayo ay tulad ni Narda na may kapansanan at kabilang sa hanay ng mahihirap.  Ano ang puwang ng pamamantasya?</p>
<p>            Ang pamamantasya ay tulad ng aktibidad ng pamimintana.  Patanaw-tanaw ka lang sa labas.  Nakatanghod ang paningin sa kung ano-anong dumadaan.  Wala ka naman talagang tinatanaw o nakikita kundi ang nais mong makita.</p>
<p>            Ginagamit mo lang ang external na kapaligiran para tunghayan sa isang relaxadong pamamamaraan ang kalagayan ng internal na sarili.  Nababawasan ang anxiedad ng internal, nakakawing sa haraya ng posibilidad kung saan pwede tayong lahat magkaagimat, sumigaw ng Darna, puksain ang katiwalian, makamit ang sosyalismo, maging Richie Rich, magkaroon ng syotang kasing ganda ni Paris Hilton o guwapo ni AJ Dee.</p>
<p>            O di ba, kay ganda ng buhay?  Siempre, dito lang yon sa maliit na bubble na kay daling pumutok sa bigat ng aktwal na kapaligiran:  Payatas, korapsyon, presyo ng gasoline at pamasahe, pagbaba ng buhay sa ilalim ni GMA, at iba pa.</p>
<p>            Hindi na maganda ang buhay.  Ang buhay, para maging kapaki-pakinabang, kailangang pagsanibin ang paglangoy sa dalawang ilog—ang daloy ng fantasya ng nagbibigay posibilidad sa mga imposibleng bagay; at ang daloy ng realidad na aktwal na ginagawalan ng buhay. </p>
<p>            Kaya si Narda at Darna ay pinag-uugnay ng matibay na katotohanan ng batong hindi madudurog pero lagusan para makalabas-pasok sa mundo ng fantasya at realidad.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>

Published by AMISTAD<br />
63 pages</p>
<p><strong>2006 carries a double significance for AMISTAD. Aside from marking the 80th birthday of Cuban president Fidel Castro, it is also the 60th year of diplomatic relations between the Philippines and Cuba. AMISTAD chose to celebrate what its president George Aseniero calls “milestones” by publishing  <em>Kasaysayan ang Magpapawalang-sala sa Akin</em>, a Filipino translation of Cuban President Fidel Castro&#8217;s famous five-hour speech<em> History will Absolve Me</em> by Carl C. Ala.</strong></p>
<p><strong> BY ALEXANDER MARTIN REMOLLINO</strong><br />
<em> <a href="http://www.bulatlat.com/">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>2006 carries a double significance for AMISTAD, a solidarity organization aiming to forge and promote friendship, unity, understanding, and solid relations between the Filipino and Cuban peoples. Aside from marking the 80th birthday of Cuban President Fidel Castro, it is also the 60th year of diplomatic relations between the Philippines and Cuba.</p>
<p>AMISTAD chose to celebrate what its president George Aseniero calls “milestones” by publishing <em>Kasaysayan ang Magpapawalang-sala sa Akin, </em>a Filipino translation of Castro&#8217;s famous five-hour speech<em> History will Absolve Me</em> by Carl C. Ala.</p>
<p>Delivered in 1953, <em>History will Absolve Me </em>was Castro’s piece in his own defense as he stood on trial for the botched siege on Moncada Barracks.</p>
<p>Ala&#8217;s achievement in translating Castro’s speech lies in his being able to give it a tinge of greater familiarity within the Philippine context.</p>
<p>The attack on Moncada Barracks was intended as the culmination of the uprising by the Castro-led revolutionary forces against the U.S.-sponsored dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista, which had wrested power through a coup backed by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) the previous year.</p>
<p>The uprising that is the subject of Castro’s speech aimed at seizing Moncada Barracks without bloodshed. The revolutionary forces had no plans of shooting it out with the soldiers at the barracks. What they intended was to seize the arms and ammunition through a surprise attack and peacefully convince the soldiers to abandon the dictatorship.</p>
<p>After seizing power, the revolutionaries would have enacted five revolutionary laws that would declare the legitimacy of Cuba’s 1940 Constitution and effect industrialization, land distribution, and reforms in foreign relations, education, housing, and labor and industrial relations. These were the same objectives that the Castro-led revolutionary forces went on to attain after finally succeeding in toppling the Batista dictatorship in 1959.</p>
<p>The 1953 siege on Moncada Barracks was botched because the revolutionaries were vastly outnumbered and were traversing unfamiliar territory. Castro and his companions were arrested and many were tortured and summarily executed. Those who survived, like Castro himself, faced rebellion charges.</p>
<p> In his speech Castro, a lawyer who had opted to defend himself in court, questions the legitimacy and even legality of the Batista regime:</p>
<p><em>Saang bansa ba nakatira ang Kagalang-galang na (Tagausig)? Sinong nagsabi sa kanya na nais naming mag-aklas laban sa konstitusyunal na kapangyarihan ng Estado? Dalawang bagay ang malinaw. Una sa lahat, ang diktadura na umaapivsa bansa ay hindi isang konstitusyunal na kapangyarihan, ito ay hindi konstitusyunal. Ito ay itinatag laban sa Konstitusyon, kshit na may Konstitusyon at lumalabag sa Konstitusyon ng lehitimong Republika. Ang lehitimong Konstitusyon ay direktang nakaugat sa soberanya ng mamamayan. Patutunayan ko ang puntong ito (nang) buo mamaya, kahit may mga panlolokong gawin ang mga duwag at traydor upang bigyang-matwid ang di makatarungan. Pangalawa, ang tinutukoy ng artikulo ay hinggil sa kapangyarihan na pangmaramihan at hindi pang-isahan. Dahil isinasaalang-alang nito ang kalagayan na ang Republika ay pinamumunuan ng lehislatibong kapangyarihan, ehekutibong kapangyarihan, at hudisyal na kapangyarihan na nagbabalanse at (nagkokontrabalanse). Na (inagaw) at pinag-isa ang lehislatibo at ehekutibong kapangyarihan ng bansa, na siyang nagwasak sa buong sistemang pinagbabatayan ng artikulo sa Kodigo na ating sinusuri, na siyang dapat nitong pangalagaan. Ni hindi ko na babanggitin ang kasarinlan ng hudisyal na kapangyarihan matapos ang Marso 10 dahil ayokong magbiro &#8230; kahit anong paghatak, pagpapaikli o pagkumpuni sa Artikulo 148, hindi ito aangkop sa mga pangyayari noong Hulyo 26. Iwan muna natin ito hanggang lumitaw ang oportunidad na maaari itong gamitin laban sa mga talagang nagsulong ng pag-aalsa laban sa konstitusyunal na kapangyarihan ng Estado.</em></p>
<p>(In what country is the Honorable Prosecutor living? Who has told him that we have sought to bring about an uprising against the Constitutional Powers of the State? Two things are self-evident. First of all, the dictatorship that oppresses the nation is not a constitutional power, but an unconstitutional one: it was established against the Constitution, over the head of the Constitution, violating the legitimate Constitution of the Republic. The legitimate Constitution is that which emanates directly from a sovereign people. I shall demonstrate this point fully later on, notwithstanding all the subterfuges contrived by cowards and traitors to justify the unjustifiable. Secondly, the article refers to Powers, in the plural, as in the case of a republic governed by a Legislative Power, an Executive Power, and a Judicial Power which balance and counterbalance one another. We have fomented a rebellion against one single power, an illegal one, which has usurped and merged into a single whole both the Legislative and Executive Powers of the nation, and so has destroyed the entire system that was specifically safeguarded by the Code now under our analysis. As to the independence of the Judiciary after the 10th of March, I shall not allude to that for I am in no mood for joking &#8230; No matter how Article 148 may be stretched, shrunk or amended, not a single comma applies to the events of July 26th. Let us leave this statute alone and await the opportunity to apply it to those who really did foment an uprising against the Constitutional Powers of the State. Later I shall come back to the Code to refresh the Honorable Prosecutor&#8217;s memory about certain circumstances he has unfortunately overlooked.)</p>
<p>Translated into Filipino, this paragraph in large part bears similarities with what is happening in the Philippines today. There is something particularly in the reference to an “unconstitutional” dictatorship &#8220;that oppresses the people&#8221; that sounds extremely familiar. The paragraph could very well have been lifted from a testimony by any of the opposition leaders – whether Left or traditional – who were cracked down upon in the wake of the foiled Feb. 24 attempt at withdrawal of support by soldiers led by Brig. Gen. Danilo Lim.</p>

<p>ATB, an Arm of Greater Terror – Senator Madrigal</p>
<p>Citing the danger of a repressive regime using an Anti-Terror Bill to create a shadow criminal justice system which, in turn, will be used as an instrument of a greater terror perpetrated by people in power against their critics and political opponents, Sen. Jamby Madrigal proposes a paradigm shift to “Human Security” whereby terrorism is fought not by suppressing the rights of citizens but by promoting human rights and justice.</p>

Paper read before the Eminent Jurists Panel,<br />
International Commission of Jurists<br />
Djakarta, Indonesia, December 5, 2006<br />

<p>The Honorable Members of the Eminent Jurists Panel, Ladies and gentlemen:</p>
<p>On the eve of my departure for Geneva last 13 October 2006, one of the leading newspapers in my country, the Philippine Daily Inquirer, published an editorial.</p>
<p>It was addressed not only to the public but also to senators such as myself, who have been called upon to deliberate on a proposed anti-terrorism law. It said that any such law <strong>“should be of limited duration and subject to an annual review and reenactment by Congress, just as we would like to see a genuine system for congressional oversight over the Armed Forces and the police to discourage abuses.”</strong></p>
<p>The moderate appeal of that newspaper reflects the opinions of many millions of concerned Filipinos. In the name of fighting terrorism we have seen human, civil, and political rights set aside in order to confer upon government unprecedented powers over those they view as their enemies.</p>
<p>The government of my country wants increased powers too. The government of Mrs. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo is insisting on the passage of an oppressive anti-terrorism law. The proposed legislation would grant it vast powers over my fellow citizens. To the cautionary charge that such a law might become another instrument of a far bigger terror and worse form of terror – that is, of State terrorism, President Arroyo and her cabinet, and her allies in our legislature, insist on denying it might ever be so.</p>
<p>But it will be so, because the terrifying provisions of the law are there for all to see and read.</p>
<p>According to the provisions of the proposed legislation, there is no clear definition of who a terrorist is. A person may be labeled as a terrorist by reason solely of his religious or political belief and his defense thereof. The bill&#8217;s definition of terrorism is too broad and too sweeping, covering many crimes that are already punishable under existing laws. The proposed law blurs the distinction between real acts of terrorism and ordinary crimes. Worse, it can be interpreted to include all acts in pursuit of legitimate dissent. In a time of intense crisis and undisguised political repression, the law can and will be used to illegalize the legitimate activities of critics and opponents of the current administration. This happened to six (6) progressive parliamentarians and members of the House of Representatives in our country, who were accused of participating in a rebellion against the current regime. A few months thereafter, five (5) Farmers collectively known as the “Tagaytay 5” were arrested and tortured without any warrant. They continue to be detained until now based on trump up charges of rebellion.</p>
<p>The vagueness of defining a terrorist is not limited to the Philippines alone. Since 1995, the United Nations has yet to come up with a clear definition of who a terrorist is.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the proposed legislation creates a new set of crimes. It grants a disturbing freedom of movement and discretion to the Philippine Law Enforcement Officers and the Military.</p>
<p>Under the present draft of the bill, Philippine police or any government law officer, including the military may engage in wire tapping for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days without incurring any criminal liability. This may be done through an ex parte written application before our Regional Trial Court to be permitted, and based only on reasonable grounds. The written application and the order of the court are declared as “classified information.”</p>
<p>Mere membership in any organization declared as a terrorist organization will become punishable by law. And any legitimate exercise of one’s right to appeal for the redress of grievances has the potential, under the proposed law, to be considered terrorism, solely by reason of the membership of a suspect in an organization, association or group of persons, labeled a terrorist group by the government.</p>
<p>Any Filipino or foreigner is liable to arrest and detention without judicial warrant of arrest for a period of 5 days. The police, military and government law officer will not incur any criminal liability for abuses or false arrests. This provision as pointed out by the International Commission of Jurists in their letter to the Members of the Philippine Senate dated 03 November 2006 would violate Article 9, paragraph 3 of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) which requires that a person arrested be brought “promptly before a judicial authority.” Under international law, the term “promptly” does not exceed forty eight (48) hours, even if national security concerns are involved.</p>
<p>Bank deposits, accounts and records may be examined through an ex-parte written application by the police and military officers before the Regional Trial Court. The written application and order of the court allowing such examination are considered classified information. The bank examination may be undertaken for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days.</p>
<p>This panoply of powers, the executive department argues, is a matter of national life and death and therefore, she must enjoy these powers. But as the editorial I mentioned in the beginning pointed out,</p>
<p><em>“We must bear in mind that the administration trying to panic Congress into passing the law is the same administration that proclaimed the February 2004 bombing of the Superferry 14 as an accident. Indeed, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo said it was the work of “pranksters.” She and other officials admitted only that it was what everyone thought it was &#8212; the country’s worst terrorist attack &#8212; in October, after she had claimed victory in the May 2004 elections. Yet four weeks after the bombing, Redondo Cain Dellosa, alias Arnulfo Alvarado, had been captured by investigators and confessed he had planted the bomb where it would inflict the greatest number of casualties. The Abu Sayyaf claimed credit, but the government laughed it off &#8212; until after the elections. Even then, the President claimed six suspects had been caught, though the two masterminds evaded apprehension.”</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Out of studies on the Roman Empire in the New Testament especially the Book of Revelation, I follow a thesis that the United States of America has become today’s New Roman Empire.</strong><em></p>
<p><strong> BY BP. ERME R. CAMBA</strong></em><br />
<strong>United Church of Christ in the Philippines<br />
Posted by</strong> <em> <a href="http://www.bulatlat.com/">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>When the World Alliance of Reformed Churches (WARC) meeting in Accra defined “empire” as “the coming together of economic, cultural, political and military power [constituting] a system of domination led by powerful nations to protect and defend their own interests” (Par. 11), it minced no words by mentioning the “government of the United States of America and its allies, together with international finance and trade institutions such as the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization) as the ones using political, economic and military alliances to protect and advance their interest of the capital owners” (Par. 13).[1]    </p>
<p>This paper is presented from the standpoint of a nation and people that has been a victim of the “American Empire.”  Starting with a brief historical survey as a case study of a suffering people from the designs of today’s Sole Superpower, the study proceeds with reflections on the Book of Revelation and on the concept of Kingdom of God.</p>
<p><strong>The Story of a People</strong></p>
<p>From tribal peoples who have already been trading with China and Southern Asian peoples, my country, the Philippines, succumbed to Spanish colonization, following colonization of Central and South America peoples. It remained under the Spanish Crown for three hundred sixty years until the new American Empire took over.  It cannot be denied that both Imperial Powers came for economic interests and used both their international political and military might for their territorial and economic expansion.  Spain came for the rich spices of the East and America came to exploit our natural resources and dominate our economic and political life and make our country a gateway to the riches of China. In the process Spain divided the rich agricultural country among its citizenry and created the haciendas that became today’s agribusiness conglomerates. America expanded its big business conglomerates siphoning our rich natural resources, minerals and agricultural products.[2]        </p>
<p>Our people by degrees rose against the onslaught of these imperial adventures. We can count some 300 revolts and rebellions in the 360 years of Spanish rule ending in a successful revolution ironically only to fall into the hands of a new imperial power, the United States of America. The US fought a long war of colonial subjugation of the Filipino people which caused the loss of some one million lives, about 15 percent of the population of 16 million at that time.  The Filipino people’s struggle against the American Empire continues up to the present.   </p>
<p>In fairness to the American people, it should be noted that there was no lack of opposition to this surging American tendency towards empire for early on there were anti-imperialists that championed the cause of the Filipino people. William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic presidential nominee in 1900, articulated the anti-imperialists stance when he declared that “imperialism had its inspiration in the desire of the syndicates to extend their commerce by conquest.”[3] </p>
<p>It is interesting to note that on the day immediately following the mock “Battle of Manila Bay,” Bishop James Mills Thoburn of the Methodist Episcopal Church wrote about Adm. George Dewey’s “Jericho-like victory” as “the fulfillment of the hopes and prayers of years” and, therefore, urged Protestant Churches in the United States “to enter in the name of the Lord and give the people of the Philippines a pure gospel.”  Four weeks later, in the same manner, Dr. George Pentecost reported to the U.S. Presbyterian General Assembly saying: “God has given into our hands…the Philippine Islands… [and] by the very guns of our battleships, summoned us to go up and posses the land.”[4] </p>
<p>Sensing that the Filipino people could not be subjugated by force of arms, the imperialists, each in their own way, brought to bear the subtle persuasive power of both culture and religion upon the Filipino people. The people of the islands at that time did not yet have a closely articulated religion – save for Islam in some areas in Mindanao and in smaller pocket areas in Luzon, and were thus easily brought into the Roman Catholic faith, and with Catholicism so much of Spanish culture filtered into the psyche and consciousness of the new converts to the faith. And since Crown and faith were closely knit entities in the dispensation practiced by the colonizers, faith and politics reinforced each other which helped in bringing the Filipinos under Spanish control. At the end of the 19th century when the work of the illustrados such as Rizal, Mabini, the Del Pilars and others, exposed the hypocrisy of the Spanish friars and provoked a critical attitude towards the Roman Catholic Church, a new generation of politically and religiously enlightened Filipinos were ready for the coming of the Protestant Gospel brought by the Americans.</p>
<p>The Americans, immediately after crushing the Philippine war of independence, sought to create institutions that mirrored their own – a liberal democratic politics and government, universal education with a strong dose of American values, a civil society based on the principles of freedom, democracy and the free market, and imposed English as both the language of government, business and the educational system. The Filipino people became “brown Americans.”</p>
<p>U.S. President William McKinley declared in December 1898 that the purposes of the United States in the Philippines was to “civilize and Christianize” the Filipinos for whom Christ also died,” with force if necessary.[5] This was President McKinley’s policy of “Benevolent Assimilation,” part of the “Manifest Destiny.”  This made the US to appear as the savior and protector of the Philippines.  And so the Philippines has indeed become a show case that the United States of America has attained its “manifest destiny,” and in wider world has established the New American Empire, the New Rome.</p>
<p><strong>The American Empire: the New Rome in the Book of Revelation?</strong></p>
<p>Out of studies on the Roman Empire in the New Testament especially the Book of Revelation, I follow a thesis that the United States of America has become today’s New Roman Empire. I am not the first to use the term “The New Roman Empire.” Ofelia Ortega, Dean of the Seminary in Matanzas, Cuba also referring to the Book of Revelation uses the term.[6]   An article from The Guardian, September 2002 uses the title “Hail Bush: The New Roman Empire.&#8221; Also an article of Michael Lind asks rhetorically “Is America the New Roman Empire? (www.theglobalist.com)[7]</p>
<p>Gordon Zerbe (“When Global Traders Ruled the World: The Choice Between Babylon and New Jerusalem as Rival Economies,” a Bible Study) and Richard A. Horsley (Jesus and Empire: The Kingdom of God and the New World Disorder) made interesting comparisons of the New Testament Roman Empire and today’s New Empire. Zerbe wrote mainly on the Book of Revelation. Horsley, using mainly the Gospels, wrote about Jesus and the Empire.[8]</p>
