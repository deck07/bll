				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Konteksto</strong><br />
<strong> Ni DANILO ARAÑA ARAO</strong></p>
<p>Naniniwala ka pa bang mas mababa ang kinikita ng kababaihan kumpara sa kalalakihan?</p>
<p>Ayon sa <a href="https://www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap">pinakahuling pag-aaral ng PayScale</a> tungkol sa kaibahan ng sahod ayon sa kasarian (gender pay gap), nakakakuha lang ng US$0.78 ang babae sa bawat US$1.00 na kinikita ng lalaki. At sa isang sitwasyon daw na ang babae’t lalaki ay may parehong kwalipikasyon tulad ng antas ng edukasyon at karanasan, nagiging US$0.98 sa bawat US$1.00 ang kaibahan.</p>
<p>Kung ganito ang sitwasyon sa pandaigdigang antas, ano naman ang kalagayan ng kababaihan sa Pilipinas? Kung pagbabatayan ang <a href="https://psa.gov.ph/sites/default/files/2019 FactSheet Women and Men_as of 01Mar2019%28prelim%29.xlsx">Women and Men FactSheet 2019</a> mula sa Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), may dahilan ba para magbunyi ang kababaihan sa usapin ng sahod?</p>
<p>Ang average na taunang kinikita raw kasi ng babaeng tagapagtaguyod ng pamilya (household head) ay P284 kumpara sa lalaking “household head” na P262. Oo, mataas nga pero tandaan nating ito ang kinikita sa bawat taon. Kung paniniwalaan ang datos ng PSA na kinuha mula sa Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) noong 2015, nangangahulugang kumikita lang ng P10.92 ang babae at P10.08 ang lalaki bawat buwan (kung ang kanyang pagtatrabaho ay 26 na araw).</p>
<p>Medyo mataas nga ang kita ng babae kumpara sa lalaki, pero malinaw na kulang pang pambili ng bigas ang kita sa isang araw. Sadyang walang pinipiling kasarian ang mababang sahod sa Pilipinas.</p>
<p>Pero hindi lang naman usapin ng sahod ang kinakaharap ng babae sa kasalukuyan. Sa konteksto ng kasalukuyang kampanya ng mga kandidato at party-list group para sa halalang mangyayari sa Mayo 13, mainam na suriin ang mga nahalal na mga opisyal sa mga eleksiyong nagdaan. <em>(Tingnan ang Talahanayan)</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/danny-table.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106771" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/danny-table.png" alt="" width="728" height="342" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/danny-table.png 728w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/danny-table-660x310.png 660w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></a></p>
<p>Kumpara sa eleksiyon noong 1998, kapansin-pansin ang unti-unting pagtaas ng bilang ng mga babaeng nahahalal sa puwesto. Kung sabagay, hindi na ito nakakagulat dahil nagkaroon na tayo ng dalawang Presidenteng babae. Babae rin naman ang kasalukuyang Bise Presidente, hindi ba? Pero malinaw sa datos na ang bilang ng mga babaeng nahalal na opisyal ay isa lamang sa bawat lima. Sa madaling salita, nananatili sila sa napakaliit na minorya.</p>
<p>Madaling sabihing ang solusyon sa ganitong problema ay pataasin pa ang sahod ng kababaihan at paramihin pa ang bilang ng mahahalal sa puwesto sa mga darating pang eleksiyon tulad ng mangyayari sa Mayo 13. Pero halimbawa lang na mangyari ang mga ito, may maaasahan bang pagbabago ang kababaihan?</p>
<p>Nariyan pa rin kasi ang itinakdang papel ng lipunan sa babae bilang diumanong “ilaw ng tahanan” na dapat na nag-aalaga ng anak at asawa. Siya pa rin ang inaasahang gumawa ng mga gawaing bahay tulad ng pagluluto, paglalaba, pagpaplantsa at paglilinis ng bahay para siguraduhing komportable ang lalaking diumanong “haligi ng tahanan” sa kanyang pag-uwi. Sa isang sitwasyong kailangang magtrabaho ang parehong mag-asawa, hindi nababawasan ang pasanin ng babae. Siya pa nga ang nasisisi kung hindi napagkakasya sa araw-araw na gastusin ang pinagsamang kakarampot na kinikita nila.</p>
<p>Opo, babalik at babalik pa rin tayo sa tinatawag na patriyarkal na sistema ng lipunang nagbubunsod ng maling kaisipan hinggil sa papel ng babae sa lipunan. Sa kabila ng retorika ng mas magandang katayuan ng babae sa kasalukuyan kumpara sa nakaraan, kailangang huwag lang matali sa estadistika dahil kailangang suriin ang konteksto ng pinagdaraanan niya. Kapansin-pansin nga ang pagbabago sa kantidad (quantitative change), pero paano na lang ang pagbabago sa kalidad (qualitative change)?</p>
<p>Gugunitain ang International Women’s Day sa Marso 8. Sinimulan ng United Nations (UN) ang taunang komemorasyon noong 1975. Bakit Marso 8? Ito kasi ang araw na nag-aklas ang kababaihan ng Rusya noong 1917 sa kalagitnaan ng Unang Digmaang Pandaigdig. Ang kanilang kolektibong panawagan noon ay tinapay at kapayapaan (“<a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/womensday/history.shtml">Bread and Peace</a>”). Ilang araw pagkatapos ng kanilang kilos-protesta, nag-abdicate ang Czar at ang pumalit na gobyerno ay binigyan ang kababaihan ng karapatang bumoto.</p>
<p>Kung may aral tayong dapat makuha sa kasaysayan ng pagkilos ng kababaihan, ito ay ang malinaw na progresibong pinagmulan ng Marso 8. Mainam na ipagpatuloy ang tradisyon ng kolektibong pagkilos ng kababaihan para sa pagbabagong nais makamtan.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bu-op-icons-luis.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-72027" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bu-op-icons-luis.jpg" alt="" width="130" height="170" /></a> His spokesperson Salvador Panelo insisted that it wasn’t because President Rodrigo Duterte thinks that the 1986 civilian-military mutiny at EDSA isn’t important; it’s just that he has a lot of things to do.</p>
<p>Panelo announced Mr. Duterte’s non-attendance at the February 25 official commemoration of the 33rd anniversary of that event days earlier. That made the claim that “he has a lot of things to do” sound like one more lame excuse in the Palace’s lengthening list of such other excuses as “he was tired,” to explain his absence in a meeting of ASEAN heads of states; that he was “resting” during the three days he didn’t attend any official function; or that he suddenly flew to Hong Kong “to go shopping.” But what made it really look like a deliberate snub is that he has never graced that occasion, his failure to do so this year being his third since 2017.</p>
<p>One can only conclude that Mr. Duterte has a dim view of the February 22-25 events at EDSA, most probably because they led to the overthrow of the Marcos kleptocracy. Like his mercenary keyboard army of trolls and hacks in print and broadcast, he probably thinks that only the Aquinos gained anything from EDSA 1, and that it removed from power a decisive man of action whose clever use of the police and military to advance his and his family’s political and economic interests deserves emulation rather than history’s condemnation.</p>
<p>Mr. Duterte has not only expressed his admiration for this country’s first and hopefully last tin-horn version of Adolf Hitler (whose “decisiveness” in murdering six million Jews he once admitted he admires). He has also demonstrated it in at least three ways. There was his decision to allow the burial of the earthly remains of the far from heroic Ferdinand Marcos, Sr. in the country’s Libingan ng mga Bayani. (Heroes’ Cemetery). There is also his ill-concealed support for Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr.’s electoral protest. Add to that his outright declaration that despite the Constitution, he prefers Marcos, Jr. over Vice-President Leni Robredo to succeed him should he resign the presidency.</p>
<p>To explain Mr. Duterte’s unashamed pandering to Marcos interests, some observers say it’s because Ilocos Norte Governor Imee Marcos, who’s currently running for senator, was one of the few local government officials to support his candidacy for president of this unfortunate Republic. But it’s likely to be due not only to the Marcoses’ financial and other forms of support in 2016. What’s even more disturbing is that it might be because of his own belief that he’s entitled to the same unaccountable abuse of power that Marcos exercised by declaring martial law in 1972.</p>
<p>Once a petty provincial despot whose powers were so unchecked they included, by his own admission, support for, if not command over a death squad, Mr. Duterte has since demonstrated his contempt for the system of checks and balances mandated by the Constitution as well as for free expression and the independent press vital to democratic governance.</p>
<p>As distressing as that may already be, the opinion polls have since found that many Filipinos share, if not Mr. Duterte’s sense of entitlement, at least his fascination with dictatorship as the path to the solution of this country’s legions of problems.</p>
<p>That fascination is founded as much on the obvious failures of what passes for democracy in these isles of illusions as on the far too common and totally baseless, fact-challenged belief that the Marcos dictatorship was a period of peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>By encouraging EDSA 1’s being labeled a “revolution,” with all the promise in that description of political and economic democratization and of ending the poverty, social inequality and mass misery that have long haunted this country’s long-suffering people, the leading figures of EDSA 1 — Corazon Aquino, Jaime Cardinal Sin, Fidel Ramos, Juan Ponce Enrile — were at least partly responsible for the perception that what had replaced the Marcos tyranny was democratic rule.</p>
<p>It was no such thing. EDSA 1 made possible the return to power of the wing of the political class that Marcos had targeted for exclusion through Presidential Decree 1081. It reestablished the limited, elite democracy that had been in place since Commonwealth days, rather than install a government run by the majority. EDSA enabled the land-based faction of the ruling political elite to overthrow one-man rule, and to repeal Marcos’s most repressive laws. Both were necessary for the country to move forward, but that was about all it did.</p>
<p>Restored by EDSA 1, the rule of the land-based, old-rich was saddled with such remnants of the past regime as Enrile and Ramos, who eventually gained even more power and in fact allowed the return of <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/02_25_19-martin-Edsa-happenings.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-106605 alignright" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/02_25_19-martin-Edsa-happenings-299x365.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="365" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/02_25_19-martin-Edsa-happenings-299x365.jpg 299w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/02_25_19-martin-Edsa-happenings-768x939.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/02_25_19-martin-Edsa-happenings-687x840.jpg 687w" sizes="(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px" /></a>the Marcoses and their allies not only to the country in a literal sense, but also to government.</p>
<p>Not only in the ensuing years after EDSA 1 were the promises of that “revolution” unfulfilled. Very early on, for example, despite such sound advice as that of the United States Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Roy Prosterman for President Corazon Cojuangco Aquino to use her legislative powers to decisively address the land issue before Congress reconvened, or else risk civil war, the latter balked and relied on the landlord-dominated Congress to later pass a land reform law so full of loopholes it became practically meaningless.</p>
<p>Mrs. Aquino’s reluctance to outrightly abolish the Philippines’ centuries-old land tenancy system — “the worst on the planet,” according to Prosterman — wasn’t entirely due to her fears of abusing her pre-1987 “revolutionary” powers. Subsequent versions of land reform allowed the conversion of agricultural lands into industrial estates, which is what the Cojuangcos did to their own Hacienda Luisita.</p>
<p>The twin imperatives of authentic land reform and industrial development — policies at the heart of the development of Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan among others — succeeding regimes belittled and ignored, and at one point even described (during the Benigno Aquino III administration) as “old hat.” Instead, it is the decades-long policy of encouraging foreign investments that has remained in place despite its demonstrated shortcomings.</p>
<p>The consequences are there for all to see: the persistence of poverty and hunger despite economic growth and, consequently, the desperate search for a solution among the country’s impoverished and powerless millions. Every election period, they are nevertheless deceived into electing to office the same dynasts and their allies whose only program is to advance their self, familial and class interests and to kowtow to whatever foreign power is willing to support their continuing dominance over the politics and government of this neo-colony..</p>
<p>What is outrageous is that it is those very dynasts who are responsible for the country’s being the basket case of Southeast Asia. Their incompetent, corrupt, and self-aggrandizing governance has been a total failure. But they blame the democracy they’ve been sabotaging for decades for the consequences of their benighted rule..</p>
<p>EDSA 1’s failure to deliver on its implicit promises of peace, prosperity, freedom, independence and democracy, for which the political dynasties are as responsible, does not justify the return of another dictatorship. But it is nevertheless another fallacy the hucksters and demagogues in and out of government are currently selling in their attempt to excuse the country’s descent into another tyranny.</p>

<p>Instantly the ripostes were vigorous – denials, condemnations – from a broad range of personalities and organizations here and overseas, including from the Commission on Human Rights. The CHR has denounced the “harassment and vilification of lawyers” as a “new trend of attacking progressive rights groups.” It called on the government to ensure the protection specifically of members of the Union of People’s Lawyers of Mindanao (UPLM) and the National Union of People’s Lawyers (NUPL).</p>
<p>The National Task Force (NTF) was formed through Executive Order No. 70, which President Duterte signed on Dec. 4, 2018. Headed by Duterte as chair and his national security adviser Hermogenes Esperon Jr. as vice chair, the NTF is mandated to ensure the effective implementation of a “whole-of-nation” approach aimed at ending the 50-year-old armed revolutionary movement, led by the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army (CPP-NPA).</p>
<p>On Feb. 14, a NTF-initiated government delegation was sent to the meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (UN WGEID) in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Its purpose: to ask the UN WGEID to delist 625 cases of enforced disappearances in the Philippines, mostly attributed to state security forces, documented by human rights organizations from 1975 (under Marcos’ martial law dictatorship) to 2012 (first two years of the P-Noy Aquino administration).</p>
<p>The delegation claimed that the Philippine government had already put in place a “strong legal framework and institutional mechanisms” to deal with the enforced disappearances issue. However, human rights groups led by Karapatan urged the UN body to reject the government request and its arguments for the delisting. Karapatan asserted that the two laws invoked by the Duterte administration – the Anti-Enforced Disappearance Act of 2012 (RA 10353) and the Human Rights Violations Recognition and Reparations Act of 2013 (RA 10368) were not state-initiated. These were enacted, it pointed out, mainly due to the efforts of the people, relatives of the victims, human rights groups, and concerned legislators.</p>
<p>Most pointedly, Karapatan told the UN that, to this day, the government has continually denied any role in enforced disappearances, such as the widely publicized case of Jonas Burgos in 2007 and most recently (September 2018), the case of Joey Torres Jr., Bayan Muna coordinator in Nueva Ecija.</p>
<p>Piggy-backing on the UN WGEID meeting, the NTF sent a team to visit diplomatic offices of various countries and aid organizations in Europe, campaigning for the withdrawal or denial of funding and other forms of support to human rights organizations and defenders in the Philippines, tagging the latter as “fronts” of the CPP-NPA. Two officials of the Presidential Communications Operations Office were with the NTF team, PCOO chief Martin Andanar acknowledged.</p>
<p>Among others, here are other instances of red-tagging in the month of February alone:</p>
<p>On Feb. 23, Iglesia Filipina Independiente (IFI) Obispo Maximo (Supreme Bishop) Rhee Timbang issued a pastoral letter strongly denouncing a flyer distributed in Cagayan de Oro City and Northern Mindanao. The flyer “maliciously and irresponsibly red-tagg(ed) our clergy,” the pastoral letter states, naming IFI bishops Felixberto Calang and Antonio Ablon, priests Rolando Abejo, Khen Apus and Chris Ablon, and “some prominent partners of the IFI in its work.”</p>
<p>“We again cry foul to these baseless accusations and condemn in the strongest terms the continuing attacks on our clergy and the IFI itself,” the letter says, along with the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT), (UPLM), and (NUPL), which are “partners in the IFI’s work of prophetic witness, social advocacy and solidarity and engagements with the peasants, fisherfolk, workers, urban poor, lumad communities, and the Moro people.”</p>
<p>All these activities, the pastoral letter adds, “are in consonance with (IFI’s) mission and fidelity to its history enriched by the bold, courageous and fearless witnesses of Apo [Gregorio] Aglipay and Don Belong [Isabelo delos Reyes] and other heroes of the Filipino church in the nationalist and revolutionary tradition of the Filipino people.”</p>
<p>Addressing President Duterte, the IFI pastoral letter warns that the red-tagging “serves as green light for the neutralization and termination” of all those the state security forces mark “wrongly as terrorists,” thus endangering the lives of IFI clergy and partners. It urges Duterte to “make history by standing for his people, by directing the GRP peace panel to resume peace talks [with the NDFP] and resolve the basic problems of our society that breed insurgency.”</p>
<p>Human rights and labor lawyer Beverly Selim-Musni, who with her two lawyer-daughters are tagged in the flyer along with the IFI clergy, spoke loud and clear: “The bias of my daughters for the poor and the oppressed is distinct, much more [it’s] my pride, since they have inherited my compassion.” Their father, Oscar Musni, she pointed out, was a member of the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG) and a political detainee under the Marcos dictatorship.</p>
<p>“The attacks against lawyers under the administration of President Duterte, a lawyer himself, are not new and not only in Northern Mindanao,” Selim-Musni noted. “Moreover, the attacks against the brave lawyers who have chosen the hard battle of fighting repressive state mechanisms is consistent with the history of our country’s repressive governments.”</p>
<p>The courageous stand taken by progressive lawyers since the time of Marcos has led to the sacrifice of the lives and liberty of many of them. After the slaying of human rights lawyer Benjamin Ramos in Negros Occidental last November, the CHR called for steps to prevent another killing. At least 78 lawyers have signed a petition asking the Supreme Court to ensure a “thorough, prompt, impartial, and independent investigation” into the killings of 34 lawyers so far under the Duterte administration.</p>
<p>The red-tagging has also formed part of the Duterte regime’s avowed campaign to prevent progressive candidates from winning in the May 13 mid-term elections. On Feb. 28, copies of a leaflet bearing the face of Makabayan Coalition senatorial bet Neri Colmenares began circulating in Manila. It depicts Colmenares, with a red hammer-and-sickle sign on his forehead, as allegedly making statements maligning the Liberal Party’s Otso Diretso senatorial slate.</p>
<p>There is of course absolutely no truth to this despicable stunt, as we shall see in the next two days.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bu-op-icons-luis.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-72027" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bu-op-icons-luis.jpg" alt="" width="130" height="170" /></a> ASKED if he caused the February 13 arrest of Rappler CEO and editor Maria Ressa, President Rodrigo Duterte said he had nothing to do with it, and that he did not “relish picking on her.” He also said he did not know Wilfredo Keng, whose complaint that he had been libeled by the online news site led to the Ressa arrest.</p>
<p>Duterte spokesperson Salvador Panelo took a more belligerent tack. He accused Ressa of abusing her power by supposedly mobilizing media organizations in her defense. Ressa had described her arrest as an abuse of government power.</p>
<p>Panelo’s attempt to turn the tables on one of his principal’s perceived enemies was as clumsy as it was typical. Journalists do have powers, among them that of convincing others of the truth or falsehood of certain claims, and contributing to the shaping of public opinion. But these powers are not in the same league as those of governments to arrest individuals and detain them, to the legal use of force, and, as the entire world has witnessed in the last two and a half years, to torture, maim, and kill with impunity. Power is not surprisingly often defined as a State monopoly, in comparison with which the power to inform pales into insignificance.</p>
<p>But journalists are nevertheless charged with the responsibility of monitoring the powerful and holding them to account. The obsession of governments with controlling journalists and their media organizations is based on the fear that while the threat and use of force can compel obedience, information can be liberating. It explains why governments often look at independent journalists with suspicion and as enemies to be vanquished.</p>
<p>Regime hostility to Rappler became apparent two years ago in Mr. Duterte’s 2017 State of the Nation Address. He claimed then that it is foreign-owned and threatened to have it investigated. Its Malacañang reporter was subsequently barred from the presidential presence. The cancellation of Rappler’s registration by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in early 2018 was also widely interpreted as part of Mr. Duterte’s making good on his threat, as was the filing of five tax evasion charges against it late last year.</p>
<p>In the context of that troubling history, the arrest of Ressa on cyber libel charges could not have been otherwise interpreted than as part of a government campaign against Rappler in which all the powers of government are being mobilized.</p>
<p>Both the Presidential Communications Operations Office and the National Press Club dismissed that interpretation, with the head of the first lecturing Rappler to confront the charges, and the second arguing that libel is part of the risks journalists must accept as part of the territory, although it did say that it was “in bad taste” for the government to arrest Ressa at the end of office hours so she could not immediately post bail.</p>
<p>To describe the timing of Ressa’s arrest as merely “in bad taste” is to ignore that practice’s capacity to intimidate practitioners and frighten them into silence at the prospect of spending even a single night in one of the disease-infested, overcrowded and hellish prisons for which this country is noted. Ressa was detained at NBI headquarters, but could have been held in a municipal jail, as others similarly accused have been.</p>
<p>From the US colonial period to the present, the 87-year-old criminal libel law has been among the means the powerful have used against journalists for either being critical or merely reporting the truth. In 2018 dozens of libel suits were filed all over the Philippines mostly by government officials against a number of journalists. During the problematic presidency of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, her husband filed 11 libel suits against 43 reporters, editors and publishers.</p>
<figure id="attachment_106488" style="width: 420px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/02_04_19-Cyber-hit-teams-.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-106488" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/02_04_19-Cyber-hit-teams--420x365.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="365" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/02_04_19-Cyber-hit-teams--420x365.jpg 420w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/02_04_19-Cyber-hit-teams--768x668.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/02_04_19-Cyber-hit-teams--840x730.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 420px) 100vw, 420px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Cyber hit teams By DEE AYROSO</figcaption></figure>
<p>Libel is indeed a common enough accusation against journalists. But just because it has become a weapon of choice of those in government and outside it who have secrets to keep doesn’t make it acceptable. Hence the decades-old campaign to decriminalize it, which assumes that while media abuse should be checked, imprisonment should not be the means to do it.</p>
<p>Because it is a criminal offense, anyone convicted of libel can be imprisoned for six months to four years per count. But that’s only for libel in print, as mandated by the Revised Penal Code of 1932. In 2011 the United Nations Human Rights Council described the Philippine libel law as “excessive.” But instead of reviewing and decriminalizing libel, Congress passed the Cyber Crime Prevention Act (Republic Act 10175) in September, 2012, in which the penalty for libel via any computer-based medium (the Internet, cell phones) was increased to four to eight years per count.</p>
<p>In his previous life as a human rights and press freedom defender, former Duterte spokesperson Harry Roque opposed the Cyber Crime Prevention Act for being unconstitutional, pointing out at one point that it is so repressive that under its provisions, one could go to prison for cyber libel for as long as 12 years.</p>
<p>The date of the passage of RA 10175 — September, 2012 — is crucial to Ressa’s case. The complaint for cyber libel against Rappler was filed in May, 2012, which means that by filing it the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) is making the application of the law retroactive, in defiance of Article III, Section 22 of the Constitution which bans the passing of any ex post facto (after the fact) law. But the NBI cyber crime unit says that the crime Ressa is being charged with is a continuing offense. The Department of Justice also claims that the prescriptive limit of one year after the offense of libel is committed does not apply to cyber libel, and that the prescriptive period for it is 12 years.</p>
<p>Both claims if upheld will endanger not only press freedom, but also everyone else’s liberty and right to free expression. Not only does this interpretation make the Cyber Crime Prevention Act applicable retroactively. It would also establish a precedent. If a law were passed prohibiting, say, the posting of anything critical of government online, anyone who did so in the past can be retroactively prosecuted for it, and even 12 years after. This would apply to anything conveyed via computers — Facebook, email, and even text messages.</p>
<p>The inevitable conclusion is that not only Rappler is likely to be targeted. Mr. Duterte has indeed threatened to block the renewal of ABS-CBN broadcast network’s franchise. He has accused the owners of the Inquirer of tax delinquencies and threatened to “expose” them. But several online media sites (Bulatlat, Kodao, AlterMidya, Pinoy Weekly), as well as the website of the National Union of Journalists of Philippines (NUJP), are already being systematically taken down in a series of unrelenting and well-funded cyber attacks.</p>
<p>There is no smoking gun to prove that the latter is the government’s doing. But the fact that all the news sites that have been and are still being attacked are critical of government, and that NUJP has borne the brunt of an obviously government-orchestrated campaign of vilification, lead to no other conclusion.</p>
<p>What’s next in the regime agenda of quelling dissent and criticism? The passage of an openly ex post facto law? A bill of attainder? (Such a bill would punish without trial.). Both are expressly prohibited by the 1987 Constitution. But the entire country should know by now that the Duterte regime wants to replace that Charter with one not as protective of those rights that despite Constitutional protection are almost daily being violated in this country today. The attack on Rappler is not just an attack on press freedom. It is also an attack on free expression, and therefore on every one.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>(Ikalawa sa dalawang bahagi)</em></p>
<p><strong>Konteksto</strong><br />
<strong> Ni DANILO ARAÑA ARAO</strong></p>
<p>Kaakibat ng mas madalas na paggamit ng bagong teknolohiya ang mas mataas na pagpapahalaga sa personal na seguridad.</p>
<p>Nakadisenyo ang mga bagong mobile phone o cellular phone (cellphone) para mas maging komportable ang ating buhay sa pamamagitan ng mga software application (app). Halimbawa, may mga app na kayang suriin ang kalagayan ng ating kalusugan at tukuyin ang pinakamabilis na ruta sa nais puntahan. Ito ang dahilan kung bakit tinatawag ang mga bagong cellphone na “smart phones.”</p>
<p>Gaano nga ba sila katalino? Bukod sa napakaraming app para sa ating personal at propesyonal na pangangailangan, posible nang “utusan” ang cellphone (depende siyempre kung gaano ka-high tech ito) para magpadala ng text message o e-mail sa isang kamag-anak o hanapin ang pinakamalapit na restaurant o sinehan.</p>
<p>Siguradong marami pa tayong dahilan para purihin ang kagandahan ng bagong teknolohiyang nakapaloob sa isang cellphone na kasyang kasya sa ating bulsa. Masusuma nga natin sa isang salita lang ang kalakasan ng bagong teknolohiya na literal na nasa ating mga kamay: Convergence.</p>
<p>May dalawang pangunahing punto sa usapin ng convergence. Una, nariyan ang gamit ng cellphone hindi lang para maging telepono kundi para maging health monitor, navigational tool at iba pa (depende sa mga app na naka-install). Ikalawa, nariyan ang kakayahang ikonekta ang cellphone nang wireless (sa pamamagitan ng Bluetooth o wi-fi) sa iba pang gadget tulad ng tablet, laptop, desktop computer at printer.</p>
<p>Sadyang malaki na ang iniunlad ng dating teleponong nakakabit sa dingding (o nakapatong sa mesa) at literal na nakakabit sa pisikal na kable. Pero ang disbentahe ng makabagong teknolohiya ay ang masalimuot na problema ng seguridad. Kung problema noon ang wiretapping, problema ngayon hindi lang ang wiretapping kundi ang pangkabuuang panghihimasok sa ating pribadong buhay (invasion of privacy).</p>
<figure id="attachment_106584" style="width: 500px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/internet-securty.jpg"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-106584" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/internet-securty-500x280.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="280" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/internet-securty-500x280.jpg 500w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/internet-securty-344x193.jpg 344w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/internet-securty-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/internet-securty-180x100.jpg 180w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Digital security concept</figcaption></figure>
<p>Nakokompromiso ang ating personal na seguridad sa sitwasyong ang ginhawang dulot ng bagong teknolohiya ay nangangahulugan ng pagbibigay ng ilang sensitibong impormasyon. Para mapagana ang app na magsusuri sa ating kalusugan, kailangang ilagay ang detalye tungkol sa pangangatawan na kadalasang ibinibigay lang natin sa pinagkakatiwalaang doktor. Hindi naman gagana ang app para malaman ang pinakamalapit na ruta kung hindi naka-on ang lokasyon o global positioning system (GPS) ng cellphone. Gayundin ang kaso sa maraming app na nangongolekta ng impormasyon mula sa atin o sa nilalaman ng ating cellphone tulad ng nakalagay sa Contacts at Gallery (e.g., larawan at bidyo).</p>
<p>Kahit na sabihing may malinaw na Privacy Policy at Terms and Conditions sa paggamit ng mga app, kailangan pa ring magdalawang-isip bago mag-install ng mga ito, lalo na kung hindi masyadong mahalaga sa ating buhay at ginagamit lang para maglibang. Tandaan nating lahat na hindi porke’t malaki ang storage capacity ng cellphone ay puwede nang ilagay ang lahat ng gustong app, kahit na simpleng katuwaan lang.</p>
<p>Paumanhin sa mahaba-habang pagsasakonteksto, pero sadyang kailangang ulit-ulitin ang mahahalagang punto sa teknolohiya’t seguridad. Bagama’t cellphone ang pangunahing paksa, ang mga isyung kinakaharap nito ay kapansin-pansin din sa iba pang high-tech na gadget tulad ng mga tablet, laptop at desktop computer.</p>
<p>Siyempre nama’y maraming praktikal na suhestyon para pangalagaan ang personal na seguridad sa gitna ng bago pero mapanghimasok na teknolohiya. Mag-download lang ng app na kinakailangan at mula lang sa kompanyang pinagkakatiwalaan para maiwasan ang malisyosong software o malware. Huwag hayaang parating naka-on ang data/Internet connection, wi-fi, GPS at Bluetooth dahil dito matutukoy ang ating eksaktong lokasyon at aktibidad sa Internet. Maging maingat sa pagkonekta sa public wi-fi (at mas mainam pa ngang huwag gawin ito) dahil baka ma-hack ang gadget na ginagamit natin, lalo na kung nagsasagawa tayo ng online banking at shopping. Hindi kailangang ilagay lahat ng personal na impormasyon sa mga gadget o kahit sa mga app na ginagamit dahil posibleng makolekta ang mga ito lalo na ng mga app developer na kumikita mula sa pagbebenta ng impormasyon tungkol sa mga nag-download. Rebyuhin parati ang privacy settings ng gadget para siguradong naaayon sa ating kagustuhan ang paggamit ng mga app, lalo na ang mga nangangailangan ng sensitibong impormasyon tulad ng navigational tool.</p>
<p>Puwede pa nating pahabain ang listahan pero iisa’t iisa lang ang ating pagsusuma. Huwag masyadong umasa sa bagong teknolohiya at maging sobrang maingat sa pagbibigay ng personal na impormasyon. Kung kailangang makipag-usap sa isang tao at malapit lang naman siya, huwag nang gumamit ng high-tech na gadget at direkta nang makipagkita sa kanya. Iba pa rin ang personal na interaksyon kahit na may bagong teknolohiyang nangangako ng personal na ginhawa.</p>
<p>Kung sabagay, aanhin nga ba natin ang ginhawa kung nakokompromiso naman ang seguridad? Hindi man natin pinagbabawalan ang paggamit ng mga high-tech na gadget, sadyang mainam pa rin ang ibayong pag-iingat lalo na sa panahong posible ang pagmamanman sa ating online na buhay.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bu-op-icons-satur.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-72031" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bu-op-icons-satur.jpg" alt="" width="130" height="170" /></a> There is probably no question that the Duterte government‘s 2017-2022 plan to clean up and rehabilitate the gravely polluted Manila Bay, at the cost of P43 billion, is a most welcome, although much-delayed, development.</p>
<p>Much-delayed because it was in 2008 that the Supreme Court granted the petition for a writ of continuing mandamus filed &#8212; in 1999! &#8212; by environmentalist lawyer Antonio Oposa. The SC is compelling government to act fast on the ecological crisis. On Jan. 20, it directed the convening of its advisory committee to monitor and verify the implementation of its decision, emphasizing the “extreme necessity for all concerned executive departments and agencies to immediately act and discharge their respective official duties and obligations… [and] set timetables for performance and completion of the tasks…”</p>
<p>And President Duterte has formed a task force to fast-track the rehabilitation of Manila Bay.</p>
<p>Well and good. However, the Manila Bay rehabilitation plan lacks “comprehensive and systematic measures based on sound science and social justice,” according to a broad group of environmentalists, scientists, lawyers, church people, a national fishers association, an urban-poor organization, and various other sectors.</p>
<p>The group calls particular attention to three points: One, the plan emphasizes the relocation of 230,000 informal settler families. Two, it neglects to hold government agencies responsible for the long-standing insufficiency of public sanitation services. And three, the group warns that “at least 28,000 hectares of approved reclamation projects across the bay threaten to undo the various efforts to restore Manila Bay’s ecosystem and natural resources.”</p>
<p>Yesterday, these concerned citizens launched Manila Bay Watch, an advocacy campaign that aims to monitor the rehabilitation program to ensure that it’s based on science and justice, that it shall serve the needs of the majority of the people, including the poor who depend on the bay waters for their livelihood, and to ensure that no new reclamation project shall be allowed along Manila Bay. They invited me to share my thoughts, acknowledging my continuing advocacy for environmental protection and conservation since my nine-year stint as a partylist (Bayan Muna) legislator.</p>
<p>The rehab plan sets 51 target outputs on solid waste and liquid waste management, informal settler families and illegal structures, habitat and resources management, and partnership and governance mechanisms. However, closer scrutiny by the group revealed that, in 2019, the provisions on habitat and resource management have been removed, expected outputs on solid and liquid wastes management have been trimmed and focused only on the coastal areas and waterways close to the bayside.</p>
<p>Most appalling is the revelation that P36 billion, out of the P43-billion total outlay, have been set aside for relocating the 230,000 informal settler families. So that was what it’s really all about?</p>
<p>Unfair and lopsided, the group of protesters said. Why? Because, per a World Bank study, the low-income families contribute only 5% to Metro Manila’s solid waste output, whereas the waste output of the total middle-income population and the commercial establishments are 9.6 times and 7.4 times more than that of the low-income. Why are we blaming the poor?</p>
<p>The Manila Bay Watch unity statement avers that the informal sector families shouldn’t be relocated. Instead, onsite or in-city public housing should be developed for them with provision of proper waste management and sanitation services. Alongside that step, it urges that fishery be revitalized in Manila Bay and preferential access be given to the small fisher folk.</p>
<p>Scientific studies have shown that the major problem of pollution is due to lack of proper regulations on waste disposal not only of households but of manufacturing plants and business establishments, inadequacy or absence of public infrastructure and services such as materials recovery facilities, sanitary landfills, and sewerage pipelines. For instance, the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System’s two water concessionaires – Manila Water and Maynilad – have connected only 14% of their serviced population to their sewerage pipes and systems and offered sanitation services to only 44% from 2011 to 2016.</p>
<p>The pollution crisis has deep roots. It can be traced back to the reconstruction of Manila’s infrastructure demolished largely by US aerial bombings, under Gen. Douglas MacArthur’s command, towards the end of World War II, 74 years ago. The Americans concede that Manila, next to Warsaw, was the most destroyed city in that war. Just imagine Manila as Marawi after the 2017 siege.</p>
<p>Revealing of where the blame lies – wrong policies, mismanagement, political corruption, private greed – is an account of Manila’s post-war rehabilitation by Gerardo P. Sicat, retired UP economics professor and former economic planning minister during the Marcos regime. In his column, Crossroads, in the Philippine STAR on Feb. 20, he wrote that the reconstruction boom of the immediate postwar period led to the development of industries replacing old services with new ones. The negligence that would spell large-scale pollution decades later started from there.</p>
<p>“The public works and city management neglected the regulation of effluents,” Sicat pointed out. “Soon, the draining of these effluents would poison the natural waterways with toxic waste, darkening and suffocating life in them.” Public works standards and bureaucracies suffered badly and the regulation and upkeep of facilities deteriorated, he added.</p>
<p>In fact, Sicat noted, public works construction not only neglected the drainage system, “but also filled up some existing waterways thought to be a hindrance toward land improvement.” Besides the failure of standards and breakup of institutional rules and processes, he lamented, “the new politics of accommodation that emerged after independence” further eroded the rules and processes.</p>
<p>Thus, building and improving roads became more attractive than digging waterways or allowing good drainage or rebuilding the city’s sewerage system. “In fact,” Sicat stressed, “politics would lead to the deterioration of the upkeep of the water services and sewerage systems.”</p>
<p>Alas, the politics of accommodation today has worsened, playing out in the approval of major reclamation projects on Manila Bay, according to reports, without the necessary risk assessments and corollary guidelines and rules. All together, at least 25 reclamation projects covering 28,647 hectares of foreshore areas are in varying stages of application, approval, and development. All these must be thoroughly examined and, on just basis, vigorously opposed.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bu-op-icons-luis.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-72027" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bu-op-icons-luis.jpg" alt="" width="130" height="170" /></a> On July 23, 2016, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Executive Order No. 2 mandating public access to information held by the agencies and offices of the executive branch. The nongovernmental organizations that had been campaigning for a freedom of information (FOI) act for decades welcomed it with cautious optimism. The Executive Order (EO) encouraged the legislature and judiciary to do the same, but the FOI advocates nevertheless pointed out the need for a law that would cover all three branches of government.</p>
<p>Access to information is both a public right as well as an indispensable means of checking corruption by enabling citizen monitoring of government. But the Benigno Aquino III administration and its allies in the House of Representatives resisted the enactment of any FOI law during its entire six-year watch (2010-2016).</p>
<p>Mr. Aquino III said at one point that the press was already “too powerful” and did not need an FOI act. He was mistaken in assuming that it would serve only the media. Such a law would benefit the citizenry most by making readily accessible information on what government is doing and plans to do as a means of uncovering and checking wrongdoing and corruption.</p>
<p>A Senate version passed that chamber, and several FOI bills were filed in the House during the past administration. But most of the latter contained so many exemptions to what information could be accessed that if passed they would have limited rather than enhanced the public’s capacity to obtain government-held information. Other versions not as flawed were prevented from being passed by such obviously contrived barriers as lack of quorum, and some congressmen’s introducing unacceptable riders in the bills, among them right of reply provisions.</p>
<p>FOI advocates initially welcomed the Duterte EO as an indication of the regime’s departure from the Aquino III administration’s opposition to a freedom of information act. Within months after the signing of EO No. 2, however, hope had turned into disappointment.</p>
<p>Not only was there no indication that the House would ever pass an FOI bill into law, the Duterte EO itself also made it even more difficult to obtain information from the agencies and offices of the executive branch. Requests for information from the media were either rejected outright because the requested information was among those that Malacañang had decreed may not be released, or they were given the run-around with the argument that the information being requested was in this or that office rather than in the custody of the agency where the request was originally filed. Some offices also devised complicated processes that made getting information from them extremely difficult.</p>
<p>The long and the short of it is that the Duterte regime, despite EO No. 2 and Mr. Duterte’s repeated claims of a commitment to reducing, if not ending, government corruption, eventually demonstrated that it is as opposed to freedom of information as its predecessor.</p>
<p>Make that even more opposed. Instead of an FOI bill, Mr. Duterte’s House allies passed on Jan. 30 a resolution making it nearly impossible for the public and the media to access their Statements of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN), which contain information crucial to monitoring corruption among members of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>House Resolution 2467 pays lip service to the Constitution by citing that document’s requiring every government official and employee to file a SALN on or before April 30 every year, but in reality violates it by undermining the people’s right to information.</p>
<p>The resolution imposes severe restrictions on accessing the SALNs of the so-called representatives of the people. The restrictions were put together by the SALN Review and Compliance Committee that Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo created, with some of her closest accomplices in that body as members.</p>
<p>Its most obviously repressive provision is Rule V, Section 14, which makes the release of information on any congressman or woman’s SALN possible only with the approval of the House plenary — meaning the majority of its current membership of over 200.</p>
<p>The congressman or woman whose SALN has been requested can also object to its being released. Only copies of the latest SALNs can be provided. Requests for previous statements will be granted only if considered “justifiable” by the SALN committee and the House Secretary General. Comparing the past and present SALNs of a government official is of course one way of establishing by how much his or her assets have grown and whether they can be explained or not.</p>
<p>The requesting party is also required to submit a form containing personal and employment information, the purpose of the request, and why copies of previous SALNs are being requested. It specifically mentions the media, and imposes additional requirements on any media person’s request, among them proof of his or her media affiliation and the media organization’s accreditation to establish the legitimacy of the media practitioner.</p>
<p>The same resolution imposes a number of other conditions and threatens the requesting party with criminal, civil and administrative liability in case he or she violates any of them.</p>
<p>Once a request is approved, copies of the SALN will cost P300 each — which means that a request for several SALNs can be costly. But in addition, the copies will be released only after they have been edited by the House’s Director of Records Management, specifically by blacking out the address of the SALN declarant, the names of his unmarried children below 18, the locations of his real estate properties, the names and addresses of his business and financial connections and those of his relatives in government, and other data.</p>
<p>These restrictions do not only make it difficult, they make it practically impossible to get a copy of the SALN of any member of the House because of the requirement that it be approved by the plenary and its release allowed by the subject concerned. But even if a request is granted, the SALN copies would be practically useless, since they have been redacted prior to their release.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the provision that requires a media person to provide proof of his or her media affiliation effectively prevents freelance journalists from even filing a request for a copy of a House member’s SALN.</p>
<p>Equally disturbing is the SALN Review and Compliance Committee’s being empowered to question and evaluate the purpose of the request. A journalist who is doing research to determine if there was a suspiciously huge increase in a House member’s assets, which may prove that he or she may have personally benefitted from, say, the construction of a bridge or roadwork by a company owned by a relative, would be prevented from getting that information by the restrictions imposed by HR 2467.</p>
<p>What is glaringly evident is that the resolution is meant to conceal wrongdoing by preventing the information to which citizens are entitled from getting to them either through their own efforts or the media’s.</p>
<p>Those responsible for this latest outrage — almost the entire House membership passed it — against good and honest governance are not representatives of the people. Like their co-conspirators in the executive and judicial branches of government, they represent only themselves and their personal, familial, and class interests to the detriment of the people’s own. That is the message HR 2467 is loudly and clearly sending to the entire citizenry.</p>
