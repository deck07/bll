				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The concomitant and worsening assaults (including extrajudicial killings) on fundamental human rights have subjected marginalized people to extreme physical, biological, psychological and social stress and have repeatedly been forced to be displaced from their land, homes, crops and other means of survival. Under these circumstances, infectious disease epidemics, like measles, and other serious health problems are bound to arise and worsen.</p>
<p><strong>By ROMEO F. QUIJANO, M.D.<br />
</strong> <em><a href="http://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>The real underlying cause of deaths in the measles epidemic is the dysfunctional health care system brought about by chronic socio-economic underdevelopment characteristic of a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, not the loss of vaccine confidence due to the “Dengvaxia scare”. Corporate hijacking of the health care system with the complicity of government, international institutions, mainstream medicine and various cohorts deprived the people of their right to health. Profit became the primary driving factor in addressing a public health problem, not public welfare as some health professionals still want to believe. Deregulation, privatization and liberalization, the hallmarks of corporate globalization, have practically wiped-out whatever remaining affordable basic needs and social services, especially health services, are available to the majority of the population. Worse, under the guise of economic development, big business juggernaut in mining, plantations, coal, dams and other environmentally destructive and socially disruptive mega-projects have devastated community-empowering and truly sustainable, poverty alleviating, health promoting and climate resilient initiatives. The concomitant and worsening assaults (including extrajudicial killings) on fundamental human rights have subjected marginalized people to extreme physical, biological, psychological and social stress and have repeatedly been forced to be displaced from their land, homes, crops and other means of survival. Under these circumstances, infectious disease epidemics, like measles, and other serious health problems are bound to arise and worsen.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/vaccine-bottle-syringe-injection-vial-450w-1272846445.jpg"><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-106444" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/vaccine-bottle-syringe-injection-vial-450w-1272846445-450x280.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="280" /></a></p>
<p>Failure to understand the true nature and underlying cause of the problem leads to erroneous and misguided response, especially if vested interests come into play. Thus, the government, international institutions (e.g. WHO), mainstream medicine and many others immediately conclude that it was loss of confidence in vaccines due to irrational Dengvaxia scare and therefore the solution is providing more vaccines and exonerating the Dengvaxia vaccine. This short-sighted solution fits quite well with the interests of Big Pharma and their cohorts. If one looks carefully into the history of measles and similar infectious diseases and their corresponding vaccines, one would discover that vaccines are not quite the magic bullets that they are purported to be. Even before vaccines were introduced, deaths due to measles and similar diseases, have dropped drastically (estimated to be more than 90% decrease in mortality rates (1). Yet vaccination is taking the credit for the decline of many diseases, when scientific evidence show that the natural pattern for the diseases is decline in numbers and severity anyway. When the first measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, government officials and proponents of the vaccine assured the public that the vaccine would provide lifelong immunity and was without serious adverse effects. They further claimed that if enough percentage of the target population were immunized, all will be protected because of “herd immunity”. Official data in 1966 then showed that the morbidity incidence of measles have drastically dropped to 95%, claiming huge success of the vaccine. However, the official data was discovered later to be not credible. It turned out that the reason for the huge drop in measles morbidity rate was because many children who were vaccinated and later exhibited rash symptoms with high fever were not diagnosed as having measles because of the strong belief that if the child was vaccinated, then it could not be measles because the immunity was supposed to be lifetime (2). A prominent naturopath offered an explanation: <em>“By calling the disease something else they are protecting their belief system, and the integrity of the theories around which they have built their actions, such as vaccination … All this is done to protect a system, and to help to save the public from having doubt as to the efficacy of methods”</em>(3). Another scientist revealed that the vaccine gave rise to a more serious form of measles. <em>“It is less well known to the general public that vaccinated children started developing an especially vicious form of measles, due to the altered host immune response caused by the deleterious effect of the measles vaccines. It resisted all orthodox treatment and carried a high mortality rate. It has become known as atypical measles”</em>(4).</p>
<p>In the US, and much of the international community, despite repeated failure to realize the declared target of eliminating measles and repeated adjustment of vaccination coverage (68%-95%) to achieve the so-called “herd immunity”, and despite mounting evidence of serious adverse effects, the dominant reductionist paradigm of “safe” vaccine as a magic bullet to eliminate an infectious disease persisted and anyone who challenged that paradigm was immediately vilified and punished .</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/close-up-foot-hand-baby-450w-1110401885.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-106445" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/close-up-foot-hand-baby-450w-1110401885.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="320" /></a></p>
<p>The fact that vaccination does not confer lifetime immunity has been officially recognized but the solution was to give the vaccine repeatedly rather than explore other options of strengthening the immune system and improving the over-all health status of population groups through non-invasive, non-disruptive wholistic approaches. There is still a pachydermatous adherence to the flawed belief that vaccines are “safe” and without serious adverse effects, despite contrary scientific evidence.  Some scientists and concerned medical doctors and health professionals have in fact questioned the efficacy of several vaccines and have warned repeatedly on the significant risks associated with vaccination. In fact, numerous studies support these allegations of questionable efficacy, safety and unacceptable risks(5,6,7,8,9). Despite the fact that vaccines do stimulate the production of specific antibodies, vaccines may in fact be destroying the coordinated and total immune system response to an infection, contrary to what has been claimed that vaccines strengthen the immune system. Several published scientific studies have shown the adverse effects of various types of vaccines on the immune system of vaccinated individuals, especially infants and children(10,11,12,13). It has been demonstrated in laboratory studies, for example, that a vaccine can weaken or disrupt the immune system and this finding has been corroborated by clinical studies that showed an increase in the incidence of serious illnesses following vaccination of children(14,15,16). Many of these illnesses, such as various autoimmunity disorders, are not readily recognized and may manifest only much later and by then, the vaccine may not even be suspected as a causative factor. Furthermore, the inherent danger of injecting microbial protein fragments, DNA and other foreign materials into the human body, especially in children, is well documented in the scientific literature(17,18,7,8). All vaccines, contain such hazardous foreign fragments and materials. Just recently, more vaccine contaminants including heavy metal nano-particulates and others not previously known  have been discovered in MMR vaccine and 43 other vaccines investigated(19). Rigorous safety assessment, including adequate, double-blind, randomized, and true placebo-controlled clinical trials and an honest-to-goodness risk-benefit assessment, have never been done by the manufacturers or supposedly reputable institutions recommending the vaccines. Safety has always been based on flawed assumptions and corporate science, not on real science.</p>
<p>Official bodies, Big Pharma, mainstream medicine and cohorts tenaciously cling to the reductionist concept of eradicating an infectious disease with vaccines and even resort to fraud and unjust vilification of  few doctors and scientists who ask legitimate questions on the efficacy and safety of certain vaccines. An illustrative example is the US Center for Disease Control (CDC)/Institute of Medicine (IOM) assessment of studies looking into the association of MMR vaccine and autism(15). Among several studies available in the scientific literature relevant to the issue of MMR vaccine and autism, only 22 studies were selected to evaluate the risk of autism after the administration of MMR vaccine. Of the 22, only five were deemed qualified to contribute to the weight of evidence assessment and in all of these five “qualified” studies, the conclusion was that there was no evidence to show that MMR vaccine was associated with autism. The committee then concluded that “The evidence favors rejection of a causal relationship between MMR vaccine and autism”. A closer scrutiny of the five “qualified” studies, however, reveals that all studies are stacked with authors with serious conflicts of interest and some are of questionable integrity. One senior author, who was an overseer of US Center for Disease Control-funded studies showing no evidence of MMR vaccine and autism connection, was accused of fraud and data manipulation and was criminally indicted in the US. In a related development, a CDC senior scientist revealed that the CDC manipulated results of a key study to show non-correlation between autism and MMR vaccine in Africa-Americans when in fact the opposite is true(20). The CDC, the WHO, mainstream medicine and Big Pharma continue to vigorously deny scientific evidence that points to the probable contribution of vaccines to the increasing incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders. Independent and reputable scientists who happen to just give a hint of this probable connection and who question the safety and efficacy of vaccines are unjustly vilified and persecuted.</p>
<p>The credibility of the CDC, WHO, public health authorities and mainstream health professionals have been seriously eroded because of corporatization, conflicts of interests, dishonesty, corruption and misrepresentation. People have good reasons to be wary of vaccines. Scare tactics and authoritarian intimidation with exaggerated claims of more deaths if they refuse vaccination will not help. Too much reliance on vaccines to address infectious diseases is not congruent with the current body of scientific knowledge about the immune system, microbial ecology and the intimate relationship of humans with the environment. It is time to rethink the reductionist, corporate driven vaccination dogma. <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>Ni <strong>DIMPLE PAZ-BONGANAY</strong> *</p>
<p>Nagpunta ako sa mall at bumili sa SM supermarket. Habang nakapila at nag-aantay para bayaran ang pinamili, nagflashback sa akin ang lahat ng mga nangyari noong nagtatrabaho pa ako sa SM Supermarket bilang isang cashier.</p>
<p>Madami na akong pinasukang trabaho para lang mai-survive ko ang pag aaral ko, pinakahuli ang SM sa lahat ng pinasukan ko. Pagka-graduate ko ng kolehiyo, nag-apply akong cashier sa SM supermarket kahit malayong malayo sa kurso ko dahil sobrang hirap na maghanap ng trabaho sa Pilipinas at siyempre, mas madaling magbyahe kumpara sa mga BPO companies na located pa noon sa Ortigas o ‘di kaya ay sa Makati.</p>
<p>Natanggap naman ako agad pero sandamakmak na requirements ang kailangan kong ipasa &#8212; health certificate, police clearance, NBI clearance, medical certificate. May mga kailangang bilhin at dapat kami rin ang bibili ng uniform at sapatos na sandals namin na sa kanila rin binibili. So, doon palang sa lahat ng ‘yun, di pa ko sumasahod ay 5K na agad gastos ko. Nu’ng nakumpleto na ang requirements ko, agad na nagpasa at pumirma ng contract, as usual contractual &#8211; 5 months kasama ang waiver na pinipirmahan na bawal kang sumali o bumuo ng anumang organisasyon habang nasa SM ka at number one doon ay bawal mag-unyon. Nagtraining pa kami ng isang araw kung paano paganahin at gamitin ang POS (point of sale o makinang gamit sa pagbibigay ng resibo), pagbabalot sa plastic at karton ng mga pinamili ng customer, at kung anu ano pa. Ibig sabihin, lahat ng ‘yun dapat marunong ka, dahil hindi lahat ng cashier ay may kanya-kanyang bagger, dahil ikaw mismo multi-tasking ka.</p>
<p>Sa ilang buwan kong pagtatrabaho sa SM, nag-i-in ako nang maaga, pero ang out ko ay higit pa sa walong oras. Ika nga ng mga matatagal na dun, &#8220;OTTY&#8221; or “Over Time Thank you!” Lagi naming reklamo ng mga katrabaho ko ay walang bayad ang overtime pero kapag late kami pumasok, bawas at hindi counted ang OT namin, at may baon ka pang report IVR (not sure at nakalimutan ko na pero Incident Violation Report ata ito). Anyway, memo ito na nagviolate ka at kabawasan para ‘di ka maregular.</p>
<p>Madalas na laging sobra din ang naire-remit namin dahil naiipon ang mga cents na minsan hindi na naisusukli sa customer, ganansya na naman si SM. Pero kapag na-short ka sa niremit mo ay bawas sa sweldo. Sa ilang buwan, madaming mga nakakausap na mga katrabaho ko ay iba-iba. Ang mga bagger at mga cashier na ang tawagan ay &#8220;buddy&#8221; bilang kasama sa trabaho &#8211; puro contractual din. May merchandiser or mas kilala sa tawag na &#8220;diser&#8221; na mga galing namang agency. Meron ding consignors na empleyado sa mga brand, may mga ilan ding regular gaya ng nasa customer service, mga manager, supervisor na mas madalas na makakaharap mo ay masusungit at laging ang mentality ay &#8220;customer is always right&#8221;, at “lahat ng ginagawa natin ay tulong natin kay SM.”</p>
<p>Kanina, habang minamasdan ang mga ngtatrabaho dun sa SM, naiisip ko ‘yung araw-araw na pagsasamantalang ginagawa sa kanila ng SM, esp. ‘yung mga cashier na habang tumatanggap ng pera ay hirap na hirap sa pagbabalot, habang ang mga bagger ay kandakumahog sa 3-4 na counter na hawak nila.Ang iba pang empleyado dun nakasimangot na dahil dapat nag-out na raw sila dahil 9am &#8211; 6pm lang pero mag-alas-otso na eh hindi pa pinapag-out.</p>
<p>&#8216;Yung sistema ng SM na hindi makatarungan, yumaman dahil sa pagsasamantala sa mga manggagawa, hindi pa dahil magaling siya o anupaman. Yumaman siya sa pagbili ng murang lakas paggawa, OTTY, at higit sa lahat pinasahol pa ng matinding kontraktwalisasyon sa SM dahil walang seguridad ang manggagawa at walang mga benepisyo.</p>
<p>Patay na ang Contractual King pero patuloy ang legasiya ng sistemang kontraktwal sa loob ng SM. 99% ng kanilang mga manggagawa ay contractual kaya mas dapat i-expose ang kabulukan ng sistemang ito. Dapat patuloy na igiit ang pagpapatanggal ng kontraktwalisasyon, dapat ding imbestigahan at i-expose ang sistemang consignor na nagtatakip sa umaalingasaw na kontraktwalisasyon, Hindi dapat na pagbawalan ang mga manggagawa na mag-unyon, dahil ang mag unyon ay isang karapatan.</p>
<p>Manggagawang Kontraktwal, Gawing Regular! <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a> </span></p>

<p>The more disturbing issue, however, is the ever-increasing human rights violations and extrajudicial killings of human rights activists who advocate for ordinary people and local communities opposed to large-scale mining operations.</p>
<p><strong>By REYVI MARIÑAS</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>In 2008, I met Manoy Tony, an elder from the island of Rapu-Rapu in Bicol region, and Frances Quimpo, from the Centre for Environmental Concerns in the Philippines (CEC), in a public forum held in Melbourne about large-scale mining activities in the Philippines.</p>
<p>In the forum, they pointed out how huge mining companies like the Lafayette Philippines Inc, a subsidiary of an Australian mining company, have substantially destroyed the environment and community’s livelihood as a result of cyanide spills, pollution and depletion of water resources.</p>
<p>In fact, Lafayette’s two mine spills in Rapu-Rapu that happened in 2005 was amongst “the worst mining disasters in the Philippines”. Recent report shows that rehabilitation work on the mine site and surrounding coastal communities in Albay and Sorsogon has been very slow and the cost of rehabilitation has now ballooned to P310 million (‘Slow progress in Rapu-Rapu mine rehabilitation’, Rappler, 08 May 2018).</p>
<p><strong>OceanaGold in the spotlight</strong></p>
<p>Today, the issue of negative impact of large-scale mining in the Philippines continues. Another Australian-Canadian mining giant, OceanaGold, is the subject of a major research study done by the Institute of Policy Studies and Mining Watch Canada in relation to the company’s dangerous and irresponsible mining activities in Didipio, Nueva Vizcaya.</p>
<p>The report is based on a number of years of study and site visits on numerous fact-finding missions in the country since 2013. It found that OceanGold has violated several national and provincial laws and decrees and concluded that the mine “has significant negative impacts on water, forests, land, indigenous peoples, human rights, biodiversity, and workers’ rights” (Robin Broad et al, OceanaGold in the Philippines: Ten Violations that Should Prompt Its Removal, 31 October 2018).</p>
<p>As a result, the study recommends that the Philippine government should refuse OceanaGold’s renewal of its licence after June 2019 as well as requests by the company for new exploration permits.</p>
<p>The OceanaGold’s Didipio Gold and Copper Mine Project in the Northern Luzon province of Nueva Vizcaya is indeed one of the manifestations of the country’s utterly flawed, anti-people policy on mining. It shows the ‘dark side’ of mining liberalisation on the Philippine economy, particularly the violation of the country’s sovereignty and national patrimony.</p>
<p>Many people are led to believe that foreign investment is good for the country because it generates income, economic development and local employment for the poor people in the communities.</p>
<p>But this view is deeply flawed and short-sighted. How can a responsible mining industry contribute to the national development of a country whereby people’s lives and natural habitat of the local community are being disregarded?</p>
<p>The Philippines ranks amongst the world’s mineral-rich countries when it comes to gold, copper, nickel and chromite. But the country’s mineral resources only benefit large foreign companies and not the Filipinos who can use these resources to develop its national industrialisation (IBON, ‘PH minerals benefit foreigners not Filipinos’, 14 Mar 2017).</p>
<p>Since the passage of the Mining Act of 1995, the Philippine government has been actively pursuing the implementation of a neoliberal program for the mining industry, under which twenty-five percent of the country’s land area becomes potentially devoted to mining (section 5 of the Act).</p>
<p>Huge incentives are given to mining firms by way of tax-free operations for the first five years and the relaxation of mining permit applications and the implementation of environmental regulations, assessment and its impact.</p>
<p><strong>Human rights violations and Australian involvement</strong></p>
<p>The more disturbing issue, however, is the ever-increasing human rights violations and extrajudicial killings of human rights activists who advocate for ordinary people and local communities opposed to large-scale mining operations.</p>
<p>Several studies reveal that human rights violations against anti-mining activists and environmental advocates are in fact perpetrated by the Philippine military and its security forces (Aytin 2016; Holden, Nadeu and Jacobson, 2011).</p>
<p>It is no coincidence that mining-related political killings have intensified since the creation of Investment Defense Force (IDF) to silence any opposition to mining.</p>
<p>Here, it is worth noting Australia’s continuous military and intelligence support to the Philippine military in the wake of the Marawi crisis. In the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) website, it states that the Australian Defence Force (ADF) provided surveillance support and counter-terrorism specific training to the Armed Forces of the Philippines.</p>
<p>Specifically, it reveals that “approximately 100 AFP, PCG, and DND personnel undertake education and training in Australia each year, while several hundred participate in training provided through MTT [ADF Mobile Training Team] visits to the Philippines” (DFAT, ‘Philippines country brief’).</p>
<p>Given the continuing escalation of armed insurgencies in the Philippines under the Duterte regime, it remains to be seen whether Australia’s military support of “advising, assisting, and training” to its Philippine counterparts would certainly materialise in a more direct involvement of Australian military personnel on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Political killings continue</strong></p>
<p>Since Duterte came to power in 2016, “there have been 30 extrajudicial killings related to mining; 12 of the victims are indigenous people” (Paul Christian Yand-Ed, ‘Mining in the Philippines: The steep price our people pay to line the pockets of a few’, Bulatlat, 23 October 2018).</p>
<p>Sister Patricia Fox, the 71-year-old Australian nun, who has been recently deported by President Duterte on the 3rd of November, urged the Australian government to take more pressure on the President over human rights issue.</p>
<p>She strongly called for the Australian government to investigate the mining activities of Australian companies whose project are displacing indigenous communities.</p>
<p>“They should start looking at Australian companies, particularly mining companies, because they’re hiring goons and … you know we have to start being responsible for what’s happening over there”, she said (‘Australian nun Patricia Fox lands in Melbourne after being deported from the Philippines’, ABC News, 4 November 2018).</p>
<p>People like Sister Pat (as she is fondly called) is relentlessly fighting for the rights and welfare of poor people in the Philippines in the hope of preserving the country’s environment and its natural resources for future generations to come.</p>
<p>It is of great importance that this issue is raised in the Australian public and expose what Australian mining companies are doing to the local communities in the Philippines. </p>
<p>The Australian people can help so much by raising this issue in the wider Australian community to stop the aggressive and irresponsible mining activities as well as the worsening human rights violations in the country. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By VINZ SIMON </strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em> </p>
<p>A threat to the right to privacy or a necessary step for facilitating service provision?</p>
<p>The debate on the National ID System, or the PhilSys, revolves around this question. </p>
<p>To answer it, it must first be understood that any state serves a society’s ruling class. Accordingly, the state maintains institutions that coerce its citizens through violence or threat of violence. Examples of such institutions include the armed forces, the police, courts, and prisons.</p>
<p>The Philippines is host to a society divided between the ruling elite and the masses of nationalist businessmen, professionals and intellectuals, workers, and farmers.</p>
<p>These classes are observable in their incomes. More than 74 percent of Filipino families earn just PhP 16,872-57,395 annually, the richest 0.1 percent earn more than PhP 702, 822 a year.</p>
<p>The distinction between the elite and the masses could also be seen in how they increase their wealth. For example, the Ayala Corporation’s fortunes rose by 16 percent last year while the marginal gains made by working class Filipinos last year have been wiped out by the recent inflation.</p>
<p>Exactly because the state serves the elite, it permits the persistence of such gross inequalities. The state also purposely suppresses the basic masses and neglects their rights.</p>
<p>To illustrate, because of state policies of contractualization, union membership among workers in the country has shrunk to just 6.7 percent of the total workforce by June 2016.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, workers’ strikes and farmers’ land occupations have been met with violence. Notable cases of strike dispersals have been reported such at Middleby in Laguna and NutriAsia in Bulacan, while land grabbing of indigenous peoples’ ancestral lands continue.</p>
<p>In the above examples, the entire state was mobilized to suppress the workers. From government cabinets, judicial courts, every manner of laws and policies, and of course, the police, the campaigns for life and livelihood were discouraged and violently pinned down.</p>
<p>It is this repressive state that will wield the National ID System. </p>
<p>The National ID System is dangerous because it allows a repressive state to identify Filipinos with greater detail and accuracy. Defenders of the PhilSys say that such an accuracy enables service provision, but whatever information is used for welfare will likewise be used also for criminality and fascism. </p>
<p>An IT organization, the Computer Professionals’ Union (CPU), warned that electronic user data are bound to be compromised. Such was the case in the 2016 Comeleaks incident where voter information, even their biometrics, were released to the public. Filipinos enrolled in the National ID System will expose their identities to fraudulent activities in the likely event that the PhilSys is compromised.</p>
<p>India’s Aadhar, a similar national ID system, has been involved in hundreds of cases of identity theft and the denial of public services because of glitches to its system. People in India have died because the state refused to grant their rights that have been tied to the information stated (or accessed) in their national ID.</p>
<p>The CPU raised more red flags in the potential use of the PhilSys for the more precise mass surveillance of Filipinos. Like Big Brother, the government will have access to every Filipino’s economic lives, and their patterns of transportation and consumption.</p>
<p>This frightening possibility of the government’s oversight over very intimate details of an individual’s life is what propelled the Supreme Court in 1998 to decide against a national ID system. The SC warned that data under a national ID system’s “vast reservoir of personal constitutes a covert invitation to misuse, a temptation that may be just too great for some of our authorities to resist.”</p>
<p>The PhilSys creates enduring profile of a person from cradle to grave. Within the grasp of military and police, the use of PhilSys’ information to track individuals and brand them as criminals and terrorists is turning into an Orwellian reality. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a> </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By BENJIE OLIVEROS</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em> </p>
<p>What has become of us? The internet, and with it, social media, that was supposed to expand the platforms where people could exercise their freedom of speech, provide constructive criticism and have their voices heard on policies, laws, and acts that affect their lives, has become instead a way to suppress this very freedom, to bully and insult others while hiding behind fake accounts, names, and relative anonymity. </p>
<p>Worse, it has become an instrument of those with power and resources to fund professional trolls to bully others who disagree with them. Under the current administration, they were even given a special office with millions of pesos in budget and resources.  The sad thing is, it is perfectly within their prerogative if the government would use the Internet and social media to explain and defend its policies and to engage in constructive debate against those who criticize it.  But it is another thing if its way of ‘defending’ its policies and actions is by issuing expletives, curses, insults, and threats at its critics. </p>
<p>There are those who disparage activists for criticizing each and every policy of government.  (To be fair, activists did commend the government for issuing policies and statements that they agree with; and activists did receive a lot of criticism for it during the early months of the Duterte administration.) But at least activists and progressive groups have been consistent in their principled positions, and they don’t attack anybody personally.  Best of all, they are not afraid to show their faces and add their names to their statements and position papers.  </p>
<p>The Duterte administration may claim the same: that they show their faces when issuing expletives.  After all, President Duterte and his social media spokesperson Mocha Uson issue expletives in-your-face.  But therein lies the problem: they curse, issue expletives, get back at their critics but do not explain their ‘principled positions.’ And of course, as the country’s leaders, they should model good citizenship behavior.</p>
<p>There lies the other problem.  President Duterte and Mocha Uson have rather emboldened trolls and netizens alike in attacking people they disagree with by issuing expletives, insults and curses.  Look at what happened to the lawyer couple that argued emotionally with MMDA enforcers.  Yes they were in the wrong.  But they do not deserve to be cursed, insulted, and called names.  So did other countless social media victims of bullying, cursing, and being called names; they do not deserve the treatment they got from anonymous netizens.  </p>
<p>By bullying, these trolls and netizens think that they are being brave; by cursing, insulting and calling people names they think they are being upright.  On the contrary, they are being cowards and bullies.</p>
<p>Try engaging in principled debates; try being constructive and compassionate; try putting a face and a name to your comments and positions; try decency; try being human and humane. Then the Internet would not be such a waste and would be a platform to advance free expression and democracy. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a>    </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rodrigo R. Duterte’s presidency has altered and controlled the public discourse so radically in its favor in ways rude and bold. One tragic result: it has restricted and narrowed the celebrated freedom of the Philippine press and the people’s cherished right to know.</p>
<p>In his first 22 months in power, Mr. Duterte has earned the dubious honor of logging 85 various cases of attacks and threats on these dual values that the Constitution upholds as inalienable rights of the citizens. The number far exceeds those recorded under four presidents before him.</p>
<p>Separately and together, these 85 cases have made the practice of journalism an even more dangerous endeavor under Duterte.</p>
<p>From June 30, 2016 to May 1, 2018, these cases include the killing of 9 journalists, 16 libel cases, 14 cases of online harassment, 11 death threats, 6 slay attempts, 6 cases of harassment, 5 cases of intimidation, 4 cases of website attack, revoked registration or denied franchise renewal, verbal abuse, strafing, and police surveillance of journalists and media agencies.</p>
<p>These cases project the force of presidential power dominating the political sphere, with zealous support from Duterte allies and appointees, and their sponsored misinformation army online and off. They have hurled at members of the press insults and unfair labels, and allegations of corruption and misconduct without firm basis in fact or in law.</p>
<p>These cases linger amid effete efforts at solution by state agencies, and in the context of the hostile and vicious discourse against the administration’s critics and the critical media.</p>
<p>The President, Cabinet members, and the House of Representatives have imposed and proposed unprecedented restrictions on journalist access to official news events. Congress and executive agencies have denied or delayed the corporate registration or franchises required for operation of media companies.</p>
<p>Some journalists and media groups have also reported police surveillance of their movement and their places of work.</p>
<p>Attacks on press freedom diminish not just the news media. These weaken the capacity of the news media to sustain the people’s unfettered exchange of ideas about public issues. Presidential intolerance of criticism is now a well established aspect of Duterte’s leadership. While he is not the only chief executive who has become sensitive to press criticism, Duterte has made sure that everyone understands that misfortunes could hound and befall his critics.</p>
<p>And yet Duterte had promised change; his government should thus tell the people when and where change has come to fruition, and whether it has triggered better or worse results. By keeping citizens and voters fully informed about what and how those they have raised to power are doing right or wrong, a free press sustains and strengthens democracy.</p>
<p>That is not quite the situation under Duterte as yet. Intimidated, restrained, and threatened with consequences, the news media have been significantly constrained to report well and fully on the war on drugs, the siege of Marawi, cases of alleged corruption in high office, questions about the wealth of the Duterte family, the public debate on Charter change and federalism, the shutdown of Boracay, and not the least significant, the incursions of China in the West Philippine Sea.</p>
<p>Rodrigo R. Duterte has brandished the power of fear. His threats and attacks bear the full weight of his office, the highest in the land. No need to test constitutional limits. All he seems to want to do is to make enough journalists understand that they should be very afraid.</p>
<p>But, like fear, courage could be contagious. And unlike fear that disempowers, courage built on the power of truth and the unity of all in media is a force that empowers.</p>
<p>To stand firm and to stand united for press freedom and democracy, to speak truth to power and to keep power in check — this much the press owes the people. And whoever is president, the paramount duty of a free press in a democracy is to defend and uphold the people’s right to know, with unqualified courage and unity. #</p>

<p>The deployment of over 600 police and 200 military personnel to Boracay to enforce President Rodrigo Duterte’s controversial closure and rehabilitation order of the island is a fascist overkill. Since when did bullets and bombs become cleaning agents for coliform, or conservation tools for flying foxes, sea turtles, and coral reefs?</p>
<p>Ironically, this is done under the pretext of “providing security and peace” and “making tourists feel safe.” In reality, we found out in a <a href="https://kodao.org/2018/04/25/no-plan-no-heart-in-boracay-closure-envi-group-says/">Fact Finding Solidarity Mission </a>held by our local affiliated organizations last April 18 to 20 that the police threatened residents that they will turn Boracay into a “new Marawi.”</p>
<p>What the island needs instead are environmental specialists who could actually study the concrete ecological situation and properly implement the rehabilitation of the island. The coliform outbreak, coral reef bleaching, and habitat loss of important flora and fauna cannot be driven away by riot drills and live-fire exercises.</p>
<p><em>Follow the updates,</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NoToClosureYesToRehab">click #NoToClosureYesToRehab</a>. Watch also, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/altermidya/videos/1025157620967032/UzpfSTEwNDQzMDM3NTIyOTQ0Mjk6MTc3NjUxNDg0MjQwNjY0Ng/">&#8216;Yan ang Totoo sa Boracay Shutdown.&#8217;</a></p>
<p>The people have suffered enough already from the loss of their livelihood and neglect by the government to the tune of 36,000 lost jobs. Now they are faced with virtual ‘Martial Law’ with restriction of movement and even suppression of media coverage. Locals have been forced to flee the island by the hundreds.</p>
<blockquote><p>Why is Duterte not deploying these armed forces instead to the West Philippine Sea, Benham Rise, and other areas where our national patrimony and sovereignty are blatantly being undermined?</p></blockquote>
<p>Chinese poachers plunder our coral reefs with reckless abandon while their military forces have destroyed over 800 hectares of centuries-old coral reefs to build military bases on top of them. Chinese science vessels have already surveyed the maritime features of Benham Rise.</p>
<p>Why are Duterte’s bullets and bombs reserved instead for the likes of Boracay? Or in previous cases, for the schools of indigenous Lumad and just about any Filipino that Duterte’s coterie labels as ‘drug addicts’ or ‘terrorists’?</p>
<p>This “gunpowder mentality” even in environmental programs is not surprising but still appalling. Former military officials Roy Cimatu and Eduardo Año, both with track records of militarizing community resistance within natural resource hubs, are at the helm of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and Interior and Local Government, respectively.</p>
<p>The Duterte government should penalize erring establishments and declare a moratorium on new construction projects, including the mega-casinos. It should implement an environmental rehabilitation program informed by science and guided by democratic and humanitarian principles.</p>
<blockquote><p>A de facto Martial Law with no concrete and appropriate rehab plan is only a waste of taxpayers’ money and will only terrorize the local populace.</p></blockquote>
<p>Boracay needs scientists, engineers, development planners, social workers, and community organizers, not the hundreds of troops and police. This armed personnel must be pulled out of the island immediately. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Jerome Succor Aba, a Muslim human rights worker and peace advocate, experienced torture in the hands of US Homeland Security while he was detained for 28 hours at the San Francisco International Airport on April 17. He was invited by church groups in the US to speak about human rights situation in the Philippines. Below is Aba’s statement following his ordeal. </em></p>
<p><em>Asalaamu Alaykum.</em><br />
Peace be upon you.</p>
<p>I thank Allah SWT, the Almighty for giving me the strength and courage to survive the grueling 28 hours of torture. Alhamdullilah! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!</p>
<p>I send my deep gratitude for the untiring protest actions mounted by friends and organizations from all over the USA- from Portland to New York City. Your quick response to my situation, such as the rally at San Francisco Airport and call barrage, has helped tremendously in my release from the cruel clutches of the CBP and Homeland Security. I also send my highest regards to colleagues who rushed to my aid upon my return to Manila.</p>
<figure id="attachment_102903" style="width: 274px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jerome-aba-with-lawyer.jpg"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jerome-aba-with-lawyer-274x365.jpg" alt="" width="274" height="365" class="size-medium wp-image-102903" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jerome-aba-with-lawyer-274x365.jpg 274w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jerome-aba-with-lawyer-630x840.jpg 630w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jerome-aba-with-lawyer.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Jerome Succor Aba with his legal counsel Atty. Kathy Panguban in the Department of Foreign Affairs on April 25. Aba submitted a letter to Foreign Affairs Secretary Allan Peter Cayetano to demand  impartial investigation on his torture and arbitrary detention under the US Department of Homeland Security.

<p>I came to the US for a speaking tour on the human rights situation of our Moro brothers and sisters in the Philippines upon invitation by local US churches. The US Embassy in the Philippines granted me a 10-year multiple entry visa, certifying that my entry to the US is legal and sanctioned by the authorities.</p>
<p>Never did I imagine that this trip would end with my torture, detention and deportation.</p>
<p>I suffered heartless and dehumanizing abuses from interrogators of the Custom and Border Protection and the US Homeland Security. They detained me for 28 hours, hurled malicious accusations at me, deprived me of access to a lawyer and contact with family and friends.</p>
<p>The horror did not end there. They ordered me to strip naked with an industrial fan blasting at me. They deprived me of food for hours and later served me pork despite knowing that it is an affront to my religion. They threatened to kill me. Twice, they left me alone in a room with a gun and a grenade. They made me sign blank papers denying the torture happened.</p>
<p>I invoked my human rights many times but they refused to acknowledge them, saying, “You have no rights. You are not entitled to a lawyer. We are the law here.”</p>
<p>That twenty-eight-hour ordeal continues to send me chills even now in Manila. Just this morning, I woke up gasping for air as I was haunted by vivid images of my interrogators in my dreams.</p>
<p>I did not deserve that kind of treatment. No one does.</p>
<p>I believe my involvement in human rights work in the Philippines is the main reason I was deported. With Trump’s administration thriving in misinformation and falsehood, there is no place for me shedding light on the US’ hand in the destruction of Marawi and the ongoing “war on terror” against my Moro and Lumad brothers in Mindanao. This US “war on terror” led to the killings of civilians, forced evacuation due to aerial bombings in communities, and has reinforced Islamophobia.</p>
<p>This is the truth the US government wants to hide from the American people and the whole world.</p>
<p>This concealment and twisting of the truth is something we are familiar with as Filipinos. Here in our country, the human rights crisis is brashly dismissed by the government. Our own president attacks human rights defenders, shamelessly accusing them of supporting drug lords or labeling them as terrorists.</p>
<p>But the truth must and will be known. Duterte’s martial law in Mindanao resulted in the extra-judicial killings of 130 Moro, Lumad, and peasants. The military airstrike in the Islamic City of Marawi left 1,000 Maranao-Muslims dead while continuing airstrikes on the whole island have driven 500,000 Moros, Lumad and peasants out of their villages for safety. Ridiculous trumped-up charges have also been filed against 406 peasants and Lumad.</p>
<p>These brazen attacks against the people and their rights were executed to protect the interests of big US corporations. The Duterte government has opened vast lands of Mindanao, including the territories of the Bangsamoro and ancestral domains of the indigenous people, to exploitation and plunder by companies such as Dole, Unifruitti, and Del Monte.</p>
<p>Now, about a million hectare is encroached and operated by mining businesses and 500,000 hectares by plantations. On top of this, a million hectare is reserved for the expansion of oil palm plantations by 2020.</p>
<p>We will not sit on the sidelines and witness our people suffer from worsening environmental destruction, displacement, poverty, and grave human rights abuses. Neither will we be silenced when we are attacked and abused.</p>
<p>And so I say:</p>
<p>I am Jerome Succor Aba. I am a Muslim human rights worker from Mindanao, NOT a terrorist.</p>
<p>US BORDER OFFICIALS TORTURED ME. They violated my basic human rights recognized and protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p>
<p>I demand justice!<br />
Justice for Marawi Victims!<br />
End Martial Law in Mindanao!<br />
Stop U.S “War on Terror”!<br />
STOP ISLAMOPHOBIA!<br />
Muslim Not Terrorist!<br />
U.S IMPERIALIST, NO.1 TERRORIST!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By SATUR OCAMPO</strong></p>
<p>After President Duterte signed this week the P3.767-trillion 2018 national budget passed by his “supermajority” in the 17th Congress, the pork barrel funds purposely hidden within it – funds that the Supreme Court, in 2013, declared as unconstitutional &#8212; have become a public issue again.</p>
<p>And it’s not only the devious undermining of the Supreme Court ruling that should evoke public rebuke and disdain.   </p>
<p>What rankles more is the arrogance with which  Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez (described in media as Duterte’s “bosom friend”), backstopped by Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno (a member of the President’s three-man economic team), flaunt their power to liberally dispense public funds for projects of political allies and arbitrarily deny the same to dissenters and critics.</p>
<p>This, at a time when President Duterte repeatedly vows to fulfill his electoral promise to end corruption in government during his term.  </p>
<p>Historically, the pork barrel has been associated with graft, having been shown up as a source of kickbacks for members of the House and the Senate.  This has most glaringly been exposed in the multi-billion Napoles pork-barrel scam, now subject to various Ombudsman investigations and court proceedings. Disturbing, however, have been the initial actions of the courts, which seem to have leniently handled the cases in ways that favored the accused legislators.</p>
<p>Specifically the instant issue involves about P11 billion (per one source) originally earmarked for  infrastructure projects of 24 dissenting members of the House: such as roads, bridges, seawalls, flood-control projects in their respective districts. “Inexplicably,” as a news report pointed out, the allocations were realigned for other uses during the meeting of the Senate-House conference committee (a small select group of senators and congrsessmen) to reconcile conflicts in the two chambers’ versions of the national budget.  Result: the 24 dissenting legislators got zero fund allocations.    </p>
<p>Sen. Panfilo Lacson, who hadn’t availed of and consistently opposed the pork barrel (officially named Priority Development Assistance Fund or PDAF), has affirmed the existence of the pork  barrel fund allocations in the 2018 budget, as he had claimed also existed in the 2017 budget.</p>
<p>“A chosen few from both houses (of Congress),” Lacson said, “are getting billions worth of projects in areas of their choices and districts,” quoting tongue-in-cheek one critic during the Marcos dictatorship, “Some are smarter than others.”     </p>
<p>He told media that he had detected what he called “owned-up projects” when he tried to excise from the budget of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) P68 billion worth of infrastructure projects with unresolved right-of-way issues, and P18.4 billion more projects lacking disaggregated right-of-way  costs.  Despite the Senate adopting his proposal to slash P50.7 billion from the DPWH budget, the bicameral committee restored the original amounts he had opposed.  </p>
<p>“That’s life!” was how Speaker Alvarez reportedly dismissed the complaint of affected legislators, asserting his prerogative to deny pork to those who oppose the administration’s policies and programs . </p>
<p>But Budget Secretary Diokno didn’t leave Alvarez alone to deal with his colleagues’ outcries.  In a media briefing on the 2018 national budget, Diokno articulated what could be the Duterte administration’s stance on the matter:</p>
<p>“There will be a distinction between those who are allies of the administration and those who are not…. If you’re with us, then you get something.  If you’re not with us, then you don’t get something…. Allies will get more.  More projects.”   </p>
<p>Acknowledging that the national budget is a political tool used by the administration to reward loyal allies and punish political enemies, Diokno pointed out this has been a long-standing practice. “You know,” he specifically noted, “that was the policy even before martial law… ‘If you’re not with us, you don’t get anything.’”</p>
<p>Diokno seems to say that because it has been the long-standing practice in Philippine politics, it’s correct and just to use the money of the people – through allocations in the budget – for political patronage.  Is retaining such an odious practice part of Duterte’s so-called war against corruption?</p>
<p>This brings us to another aspect of this issue, which demonstrates how Speaker Alvarez can be as reckless, mean, and vicious as his “bosom friend” towards the Makabayan bloc of seven progressive partylist representatives.   </p>
<p>Having been alluded to as being among the 24 legislators who got zero project funding, the Makabayan bloc assserted that they have consistently shunned and opposed the hidden pork in the national budget.</p>
<p>Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Isagani Zarate clarified:</p>
<p>“Since my first term in Congress iin 2013 and until now, I did not partake of any pork-barrel- type congressional allocation in pursuance of our advocacy against patronage politics and the pork barrel system.”</p>
<p>To which ACT Teachers Rep. Antonio Tinio seconded: “Consistent with our stand against the pork barrel system, we have no infrastructure projects… As far as we are concerned, there’s nothing to ‘zero.’”</p>
<p>Alvarez confirmed that the Makabayan bloc had “not accessed funds from Congress at all.” But,  rather than commend them for it, he chose to make an unfounded and unfair insinuation.</p>
<p>“We do not know where they get funds for projects for their constituents,” said the speaker. “All we know is that the communist rebels, with whom they have an ideological and political affinity, impose what’s known as revolutionary taxation in areas where they operate.” He added that the Makabayan legislators had not made a “clear and unequivocal condemnation of revolutionary taxation.” </p>
<p>Zarate’s group promptly denounced Alvarez’s “malicious and dangerous red tagging,” saying the “House leadership just wants to divert attention from the now-awakened issue of thriving pork barrel in Congress.”</p>
<p>It used to be the government claim, since Gloria Arroyo’s term, that the progressive partlylist bloc was channelling its PDAF funds to the NPA.   Arroyo (now a Duterte ally) went as far as having the six progresssive partylist representatives then preposterously charged in court with rebellion.  </p>
<p>The Supreme Court ordered the case dismissed for lack of merit. What is Alvarez talking about now?</p>
<p><em>Merry Christmas to all!</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By SONNY AFRICA</strong><br />
<a href="http://ibon.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ibon Foundation</a></p>
<p>The Duterte administration’s Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) bill reportedly due for ratification by Congress this week burdens the poor with higher consumption taxes so that the rich can have higher take-home pay. The Department of Finance (DOF) used income tax gains for a few middle-class families as a smokescreen for even greater tax gains by the richest Filipinos and, worse, higher consumption taxes for the majority of poor Filipinos.</p>
<p>The bicameral conference committee on TRAIN on Monday reconciled the Senate and House versions. Proponents have grossly exaggerated how millions are supposedly exempted from paying income tax. They have also downplayed how tens of millions of the country’s poorest will be burdened by higher prices on basic goods and services without getting any income tax exemptions.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of Filipinos do not get any income tax benefits from TRAIN. Most of the country’s total 22.7 million families do not pay income tax because they are just minimum wage earners or otherwise in informal work with low and erratic incomes. Even if TRAIN reduces income taxes paid by most of the reported 7.5 million personal income taxpayers, this still leaves as much as 15.2 million families without any income tax gains.</p>
<p>A reported 6.8 million low- and middle-income families will be completely exempted because they are earning less than the Php250,000 threshold for income tax to start to be paid. These families certainly deserve income tax cuts to cope with rising costs of living. But it is misleading to claim “6.8 million” benefiting from TRAIN because this figure includes millions of minimum wage earners already exempted by law. If anything, the DOF, House and Senate have even proposed to remove this minimum wage exemption.</p>
<p>The country’s rich are meanwhile among the biggest gainers from TRAIN’s income tax reforms. Low income and middle class families earning up to some Php60,000 a month will have a few thousand up to around Php80,000 additional take-home pay annually. The richest 1% of families with incomes of Php1.5 million or more a year will have an average of Php100,000 to over Php300,000 additional take-home pay annually especially when income taxes are lowered further in 2023. This is on top of how the rich will pay billions of pesos less in estate and donor taxes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the poorest 15.2 million Filipino families not getting any increases in take-home pay will have to deal with more expensive food and drinks, cooking expenses, jeepney and bus fares, electricity and other goods and services next year. Prices will increase because of the direct and indirect effect of higher taxes on: sugar-sweetened drinks; oil products including liquid petroleum gas (LPG), kerosene, diesel, and gasoline among others; and coal. The burden on poor Filipinos can only get worse once it becomes clear what value-added tax (VAT) exemptions will be removed.</p>
<p>The Duterte administration’s TRAIN runs over the poor to avoid taxing the rich. Hundreds of billions of pesos can be generated if only the government were unafraid to impose higher taxes on the country’s wealthiest families who have accumulated trillions in pesos and can well afford to contribute more to government revenues than they already do. Planned higher taxes on cars and cosmetic surgery are miniscule compared to the wealth they have. If passed into law, TRAIN only confirms the Duterte administration’s anti-poor and pro-rich economic policies. <strong><em>Reposted by</em></strong> <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a>  </p>
