				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/09/07/not-just-senator-trillanes/bulatlat-perspective/" rel="attachment wp-att-104523"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bulatlat-perspective.png" alt="" width="140" height="101" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-104523" /></a>Since the arrest and eventual posting of bail of news site Rappler’s chief Maria Ressa, Malacanang’s spin doctors have been attempting to absolve the president from allegations of curtailing press freedom and grave abuse of power. </p>
<p>Still, the political backlash that the Duterte administration is getting has been unforgiving, and rightly so. Even the simplest of minds can read between the line that the media repression these days is but part of efforts to stifle the slightest dissent towards installing an open dictatorship government that Duterte has long been dreaming of. </p>
<p>The media, as the fourth estate, plays a big role in ensuring that genuine democracy is in place. For the obvious reasons, only those who are threats to a just and truly democratic country would want to silence the press, most especially those that air and amplify the grievances of ordinary mortals. </p>
<p>Ressa’s arrest brought to fore the sorry state of press freedom in the country, even when a former journalist and now senatorial candidate recently painted a rosy picture of what he believed was an “isolated” Rappler case. </p>
<p>It is not. </p>
<p>In fact, Ressa is not the first to be subjected to such attacks. Dominant media outfits such as ABS-CBN and the Philippine Daily Inquirer and alternative media outfits are also under attack. </p>
<p>Alternative and campus journalists were among those arrested while covering the violent dispersal of NutriAsia workers’ picket last year. </p>
<p>Back in December, several local papers published identical stories tagging the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines as front of the Communist Party of the Philippines. Such red baiting is not new to NUJP, Bulatlat and other alternative media outfits. </p>
<p>Lately, more and more websites of online news, media groups, and even people’s organizations are being subjected to a politically-driven and well-funded distributed denial of service (DDoS), a form of cyber-attack that overwhelms the website’s server with millions of fake and dubious traffic to shut it down.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Negros Occidental, a province known for its robust community papers, at least 15 journalists were among those named in a list being circulated of purported drug protectors.</p>
<p>Worse, 12 journalists have been killed and about 85 cases of threats and harassments were documented by media organizations since Duterte assumed power until November 2018. </p>
<p>The present administration appears to be ignorant of the lessons of the conjugal Marcos dictatorship and how the media and the people fought for press freedom. It has forgotten how the media, in the past, has risen above all state-sponsored attacks to inform, educate and guide the public in their decision-making and actions.</p>
<p>The day of reckoning will soon be here. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/09/07/not-just-senator-trillanes/bulatlat-perspective/" rel="attachment wp-att-104523"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-104523" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bulatlat-perspective.png" alt="" width="140" height="101" /></a></p>
<p>Three months before the national elections, the Commission on Elections (Comelec) disqualified three party-list groups belonging to the Makabayan coalition.</p>
<p>The Manggagawa Party-List’s appeal for accreditation as party-list organization was <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2019/01/23/workers-to-comelec-let-manggagawa-party-list-run-in-2019-polls/">dismissed</a> by Comelec. They represent the workers, migrant workers and their families, the public transport drivers and the urban poor. In its decision, Comelec said that Manggagawa failed to state that it does not receive funds from the government.</p>
<p>Aksyon Health Workers Party-List, meanwhile, was disqualified for failure to prove that they belong to the marginalized sector. Aksyon Health Workers represents health workers from the private and the public sectors. The Comelec also dismissed the petition for registration of the People’s Surge Party-List, which represents victims of disasters.</p>
<p>On the contrary, party-list groups with questionable credibility and advocacies were allowed by the Comelec to participate this coming elections. This includes Mocha Uson’s AA-Kasosyo Party and Duterte Youth led by Ronald Cardema, Duterte’s avid supporter and chairman of the Kabataan for Bongbong Movement, a youth organization supporting Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the son of the ousted dictator Ferdinand Marcos.</p>
<p>Partylist groups with rich nominees have been accredited, including One Patriotic Coalition of Marginalized Nationals, also called as 1-Pacman. Its representative, Michael Romero, was named as the richest legislator in 2018 based on his Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth. His <a href="https://www.rappler.com/nation/207353-list-richest-poorest-house-representatives-2017">net worth</a> in 2017 is P7.29 billion ($138 million). Romero was also reported to have participated in <a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/ancx/culture/art/09/24/18/how-the-boceto-was-sold?fbclid=IwAR1ymfgyN27ZqC14ZD2CREzcLNNcCZv4e4en-lMddhLIMqOuPIgz1tGchMY">an auction</a> with a bid of P50 million over an artwork in 2018.</p>
<p>Romero is the chief executive officer of the <a href="http://www.harbourcentre.com.ph/new/CorporateProfile.htm">Harbour Centre Port Terminal, Inc</a>., chairman of the 168 Ferrum Pacific Mining Corporation and vice chairman of AirAsia Philippines.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the second richest legislator in 2017 is also party-list representative. Diwa Party-List (Dignidad sa Bawat Manggagawa) Rep. Emmeline Aglipay Villar&#8217;s reported net worth is P1 billion ($19 million). She is the wife of Department of Public Works and Highways Secretary Mark Villar. She is now with the Department of Justice as undersecretary after President Duterte appointed her last year.</p>
<p>These billionaires whose party-list groups claimed to be for the marginalized never spoke against anti-poor policies.</p>
<p>By allowing these partylist groups to run, Comelec does not only bastardize the party-list system but also proves itself to be biased and partisan, anti-poor and pro-rich. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>
<p><em>Erratum: Emmaline Aglipay Villar was appointed by President Duterte as Department of Justice undersecretary in July 2018. She is no longer the nominee of Diwa Partylist. The author mentioned that Villar is running as the nominee of the Diwa Partylist. We regret the mistake. </em></p>

<p>Just before 2018 ended, President Rodrigo Duterte’s supermajority in the House of Representatives, headed by former President now House Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, practically railroaded and laid down the way for charter change that will supposedly establish a federal form of government. But the devil is in the detail, so they say. And looking closely through the veil that the supposed shift to a federal form of government has created is alarming and will definitely put in peril the interests and welfare of the Filipino people.</p>
<p>The shift to a federal form of government has been Duterte’s pet issue since he began his presidential journey and later formed a commission for this. Early on, critics were quick to point out that the moves to amend the Constitution is aimed at installing an authoritarian government that will open up the country’s resources to foreign plunder.</p>
<p>At present, the pending bill to amend the Constitution – the Resolution of Both Houses No. 15 – has “little to do with federalism” and more on “extending current politicos&#8217; terms to 2022, lifting term limits, strengthening political dynasties, and allowing greater foreign control over the economy, said human rights lawyer and former Bayan Muna Rep. Neri Colmenares.</p>
<p>All these are quite enticing to the few and the powerful, considering that they, too, in the past when they were the ones in power, have pushed for amendments to the Constitution, most especially on the economic restrictions of the present charter.</p>
<p>Deleting or watering down the nationalist provisions of the Constitution will pose threats to land ownership in a country where its farmers are landless, and to job security in the midst of an all-time high unemployment rate. As it stands now, the Duterte administration has failed to curb poverty as the economic growth is at its slowest for the past three years, according to independent thinktank Ibon Foundation.  </p>
<p>As in the past moves to amend the Constitution, government agencies have failed to present concrete data to prove that opening up the country’s resources to foreign direct investment will resolve widespread poverty and inequality in the country. In fact, nationalist economists have long said that despite the ever-increasing foreign direct investments in the country since the 1980s, severe inequality in the country has worsened, resulting in an increase in unemployment rate, and forced labor migration.</p>
<p>Ultimately, opening up the country’s finite resources will rob it of an opportunity to reap someday the rewards of a genuine land reform and the development of its heavy industries, which, progressives say, are the answers to the chronic poverty that majority of the Filipino people are experiencing. Meanwhile, self-serving few stands to gain so much from a charter change.</p>
<p>And so while the moves to amend the Constitution may unite the powerful, it may also unite the broader public in strong, defiant resistance – DDS or not. All eyes on the Senate until February 12. Let the people’s voice be heard. (Bulatlat.com)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/09/07/not-just-senator-trillanes/bulatlat-perspective/" rel="attachment wp-att-104523"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bulatlat-perspective.png" alt="" width="140" height="101" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-104523" /></a>&#8220;<em>Umalis kayo diyan. Sabihin ko diyan sa mga Lumad ngayon, umalis kayo diyan. Bobombahan ko &#8216;yan. Isali ko &#8216;yang mga istruktura ninyo</em>.&#8221; </p>
<p>These were the exact words of President Duterte on July 24, 2017.  Since then, there has been no let up in the attacks against the Lumad, most especially school children and their alternative learning centers that did not only provide knowledge but also help put food on their table. These schools built by the Lumad themselves with the support of Church groups aim to uplift the living conditions of the Lumad who have long been suffering from government neglect. </p>
<p>Under martial law,  extrajudicial killings, forcible closure of the Lumad schools, red baiting of community leaders, teachers, and their students, among other gross human rights violations, intensified. </p>
<p>Worse, state security forces recruit community members to become their attack dogs. The Lumad are then pit against each other, bastardizing their rich culture and sense of community as paramilitary forces carry out the most atrocious human rights violations such as the infamous Lianga massacre on Sept. 1, 2015. </p>
<p>And so the recent illegal detention and the eventual filing of a trumped-up human trafficking case against former Bayan Muna Rep. Satur Ocampo, current ACT Teachers Rep. France Castro, and many other human rights defenders and child rights advocates does not come as a surprise. Their arrest cannot be seen as separate from the long and arduous struggle of the Lumad in defense of their right to ancestral domain and right to self-determination. </p>
<p>The Lumad have been at the forefront of defending their land against big, foreign mining corporations, whose extractive activities threaten their very existence. </p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="4KHXofhBaW"><p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2016/09/01/waters-dulyan-flow-free/">The waters of Dulyan flow free</a></p></blockquote>

<p>For the past years, they have been going to town in an effort to amplify their voices and gain the support of the broader ranks of people, both here and abroad. </p>
<p>Their struggle has created more than enough noise to earn the ire of the president who is incapable of tolerating the slightest political dissent and is further sliding down to the militarist path instead of addressing the roots of the armed conflict. Duterte’s actions benefit the ruling few and the foreign investors eyeing Lumad areas for their corporate interests.  </p>
<p>And so the likes of Ocampo, Castro, and the rest who are charged of this yet another false and incredulous human trafficking case are depicted as evil who supposedly abuse school children, and branded as so-called terrorists. </p>
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="Hx2CiunYoK"><p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/11/29/talaingod-pnp-charges-castro-ocampo-and-others-with-kidnapping/">Talaingod police charges Castro, Ocampo, others with kidnapping</a></p></blockquote>

<p>But who is really bringing terror here? Obviously, the very same who threatened to bomb Lumad schools and his military and paramilitary carrying out such order. </p>
<p>Who is afraid of the Lumad and their supporters? Obviously, the powers that be who are terrified of the people&#8217;s dissent and unity. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a> </p>

<p><em>“Bawat bansa ay may sariling wika. Habang may sariling wika ang isang bayan ay taglay niya ang kalayaan. Ang wika ay pag-iisip ng bayan.” – Simoun kay Basilio, El Filibusterismo, Kabanata 7 </em></p>
<p>Kamaikailan lang ay <a href="https://www.manilatimes.net/supreme-court-upholds-k-to-12/465678/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naglabas na ng desisyon ang Korte Suprema</a> ukol sa pinagsama-samang petisyon na kumekwestyon sa constitutionality ng programang K to 12 ng gobyerno. Kabilang sa rito ang <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/04/15/filipino-language-defenders-ask-sc-to-stop-ched-memo-order-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">petisyong isinampa ng Tanggol Wika noong Abril 2015</a> para itigil ang implementasyon ng “Revised General Education Curriculum,” o kilala rin bilang Commission on Higher Education Department (Ched) Memorandum Order (CMO) 20.</p>
<p>Ilang araw lamang ay <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/04/22/victory-filipino-language-defenders-laud-sc-for-tro-on-ched-memo-order-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ibinaba ng Korte Suprema ang temporary restraining order (TRO)</a> laban sa pagpapatupad ng CMO 20 at pinasasagot ang noo’y Ched Commissioner Patricia Licuanan at Pangulong Benigno Aquino III.</p>
<p>Ngunit makalipas ang tatlong taon at kahit walang oral arguments na naganap, pumabor ang mataas na hukuman sa K to 12 program kasama na ang pagtatanggal ng TRO sa CMO 20.</p>
<p>Ang CMO 20 ay nagbubuwag ng Filipino, panitikan at Philippine government and Constitution bilang mandatory general education na mga asignatura sa kolehiyo.</p>
<p>Ayon sa <a href="http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/pdf/web/viewer.html?file=/jurisprudence/2018/october2018/216930.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">desisyon</a> na isinulat ni Associate Justice Benjamin Caguioa, hindi raw salungat sa kahit ano mang batas ang CMO 20. Hindi raw nakasaad sa batas na ang Filipino at Panitikan ay dapat na kasama bilang asignatura sa kolehiyo. Ayon pa sa desisyon, <em>“…It is within the authority of the Ched to determine the GE distribution requirements. The Court also reiterates that the study of Filipino and Panitikan can easily be included as courses in the tertiary level, if the HEIs wish to.” </em></p>

<p>Makatwiran lamang ang pagtutol ng mga eksperto, makabayan, akedemiko, guro at masusugid na tagapagpagtaguyod ng ating wika sa desisyong ito Korte Suprema. Ang paglalabas ng desisyon ng mataas na hukuman na hindi dinidinig ang mga argumentong inihapag sa mga isinampang petisyon ay maaaring repleksyon din ng pagbabalewala sa ating sariling wika.</p>
<p>Ayon nga sa pahayag ng Sentro ng Wikang Filipino ng Unibersidad ng Pilipinas-Diliman “malinaw na sintomas ito ng kanilang kakulangan sa pag-unawa sa ambag ng wikang Filipino at panitikan ng Pilipinas sa tuloy-tuloy na paghubog ng kaalaman at kamalayan ng ating mag-aaral upang higit nilang makilala at pahalagahan ang sarili nating kultura bilang mga Pilipino.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iginigiit noon pa man ng mga nakikipaglaban para sa pagpapanatili ng asignaturang Filipino at panitikan na sa kolehiyo maaaring mas mapag-aralan nang malaliman ang wikang Filipino, mas mataas na antas ng diskusyon at talakayan.</p>
<p>Ayon pa sa Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT), pinahina ng programang K to 12 ang pagtuturo ng nasyunalismo at pagpapaunlad sa tunguhing maglingkod sa bayan. Ayon sa grupo, tinanggal na ang pagtuturo ng kasaysayan ng bansa at nawala na ang konsentradong pag-aaral sa panitikan at kultura ng Pilipinas sa junior high school.</p>
<p>Kaya naman sa pananaw ng ACT, ang <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2016/01/23/up-students-protest-colonial-anti-filipino-curricular-reforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">K to 12 ay isang neoliberal at makadayuhang patakarang</a> hindi naman magreresolba sa mga dekada nang problema ng eduksayon ng bansa.</p>
<p>Kaalinsabay ng pagtatanggal ng Filipino at panitikan sa kolehiyo ay pagbubuo ng <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/04/24/not-k12-but-natl-industrialization-to-solve-joblessness-kmu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">senior high school na magsisilbing murang lakas paggawa para sa mga korporasyon.</a></p>
<p>Malinaw na walang ibang makikinabang sa mahinang pagtangan ng ating wika, panitikan at kultura kundi ang mga dayuhang interes. Ang mga sunud-sunuran sa mga dikta ng dayuhan ay handang isuko ang mga ito pati na ang ating karapatan sa sariling pagpapasya.</p>
<p>Tulad nga ng sinabi ni Simoun kay Basilio sa nobelang El Filibusterismo, “ang wikang katutubo ay isa sa mga katangian ng pagkabansa.” Kailangan ang wika at panitikan upang palakasin ang ating damdaming Pilipino. Kung wala ito, lalong lalala ang kaisipang kolonyal.</p>
<p>Ayon din sa SWF-UPD, ang wika at panitikan ay isang paraan ng paglalahad ng damdamin at kaisipan ng mamamayan. Kung aalisin ito sa proseso ng pagkatuto, hindi magiging kritikal ang mga mag-aaral sa pagsusuri nito sa lipunang kanyang ginagalawan.</p>
<p>Tandaan natin na ang panitikang kritikal sa umiiral na sistemang mapagsamantala ay sinusupil upang manatili ang mga nasa kapangyarihan sa kanilang poder.</p>
<p>Minsang sinabi ng Pambansang Alagad ng Sining sa Panitikan, <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2014/06/25/educators-students-form-alliance-to-defend-filipino-language-subject/">Dr. Bienvenido Lumbera</a>, “Kinakailangang kilalanin na ang malaking dahilan ng problema ay ang kolonyal na pinanggalingan. At yung kolonyal na pinanggalingan ay isang problema na hindi mabubura ng gayun gayun lamang. Kailangang ang kasalukuyang kabataan, henerasyon ng mga taong nasa larangan ng edukasyon ay kumilala na may malubhang naganap sa ating mga isipan bunga ng mga pananakop ng mga taga kanluran sa atin. At ang pananakop na yan ay kailangang kilalanin at iwaksi.”</p>
<p>Huwag nating hayaang mawala ang ating wika, ang ating sariling identitad na kailangan sa pag-unlad natin bilang isang bansa. &lt;a href=&#8221;https://www.bulatlat.com&#8221;&gt;&lt;img title=&#8221;This story is from Bulatlat.com&#8221; src=&#8221;https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg&#8221; alt=&#8221;(https://www.bulatlat.com)&#8221; height=&#8221;16&#8243; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bulatlat-perspective.png"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bulatlat-perspective.png" alt="" width="140" height="101" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-104523" /></a></p>
<p>A few days ago, the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) approved the 12-percent and 17-percent rate increases respectively by Maynilad and Manila Water. The government agency approved it during the fifth rate rebasing held since the water utilities in the Greater Manila Area were privatized in the late 90s. This rebasing sets the water rate for the next five years. The MWSS approved the hikes despite unanswered questions from consumer groups. Chief of which is: what are the bases for the water rate increases this time? </p>
<p>The MWSS and the water companies did not give the consumers&#8217; groups documents or explanations of the basis of raising water rates. Representatives of consumers’ groups repeatedly asked to no avail.<br />
<figure id="attachment_68010" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/marchforwater.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" class="size-full wp-image-68010" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/marchforwater.jpg 640w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/marchforwater-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">FILE PHOTO 2013: Marching against water privatization and excessive water rates, to the gates of main offices of Maynilad, Manila Water and MWSS (bulatlat.com)</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Human rights lawyer and former Bayan Muna Rep. Neri Colmenares said that during the “consultations,” the MWSS at first refused to disclose how much was being demanded by the concessionaires. Later, the MWSS posted the “business plan” of the concessionaires in their website. But it gave no coherent explanation of why Maynilad and Manila Water were asking for rate increases. It did not give many details of their costing. Why and how they got the MWSS to agree to increase the water rates is not readily transparent to the public. Yet, the public has reasons to question the rates.</p>
<p>The water companies have billions of pesos in overbilled amounts accumulated over the years, the Water for the People Network said in many statements. The MWSS has been repeatedly urged to ask the concessionaires to return whatever income tax the public previously paid the concessionaires, for one thing. It has been told that unless a refund was implemented, there should be no talk of any increases.</p>
<p>Since the water companies were transferred to private operators, the water rates have increased by 973 percent and 583 percent, for Manila Water and Maynilad, respectively. The water companies have also profited more than the 12 percent they are supposed to reap, the consumer groups said. </p>
<p>So much so that in the previous rate rebasing in 2013, massive protests prompted the MWSS to suspend the water companies’ requested rate hikes. It became widely known then that Maynilad and Manila Water were indeed passing on to the consumers almost every expense, including luxuries in office, travels, future investments, the costs of their mismanagement, and their corporate income taxes. </p>
<p>With Maynilad, the consumers shouldered the costs of its apparent mismanagement, thus saving it from bankruptcy. From 1997 to 1998 the Asian crisis suddenly plunged the peso value against the dollar by 100 percent. As a result, the loan assumed by Maynilad when it took over the business from the government became twice as large also. But unlike Manila Water, Maynilad reportedly did not hedge its foreign currency exposure. It proceeded to recover the added costs of peso devaluation to the consumers. To survive an impending bankruptcy, to continue operating, profiting and repaying the loans at the expense of its consumers, it needed to at least double the approved water rate at the time of P4.96. But for some reason that consumer groups are asking up to now in Supreme Court filings, Maynilad had been allowed to increase rates of P10.27 per cubic meter since 2005. It was already way more than the amount required to bail out Maynilad. And yet, as accountant Marcelo Tecson and other consumers asked the Supreme Court, the increases piled on top of another even after Maynilad came out of rehabilitation in 2013. </p>
<p>On top of charging the consumers with their guaranteed profit levels, it became known that in past rate rebasing the water companies have also charged the consumers for projects that were not implemented and did not seem certain to be implemented. These multi-billion projects include the construction of new dams and rehabilitation of existing dams. Complaints against the MWSS decisions on water rate hikes asked why the water companies were allowed to “recover” what they did not spend. And in the first place, assuming they actually spent on it, why allow them to pass on the investment costs to consumers when privatization was supposed to have freed us of that burden? </p>
<p>In the rate rebasing in 2013, the water companies did not get their demanded rate increases as they usually did. Because of people’s protests, the MWSS conducted the rate rebasing with public consultation for the first time. </p>
<p>But, guided by the <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2017/08/18/wpn-duterte-rescind-concession-agreement-maynilad-refund-consumers/">concession agreement</a> that the consumers also want the government to revoke, saying it&#8217;s utterly onerous, the private water companies resorted to the next available means to them to get the pricing they demanded. They resorted to international arbitration. They filing their case with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Chamber_of_Commerce">International Chamber of Commerce</a>, the largest, most representative business organization  in the world. The <a href="https://www.uscib.org/international-chamber-of-commerce-icc-ud-754/">views of the international business</a> courses from this body, and it’s heard as such even by the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the G20 and many other intergovernmental bodies, both international and regional. </p>
<p>Unfortunately for the consumers, an international arbitration court formed by such an organization is more a court for ironing out the kinks in the operations of big businesses than a court for dispensing justice. By being there, too, for the ‘poor’ businesses that found an ax to grind against the government of a country, the businesses get a venue to demand that their desired profit levels as agreed upon in onerous contracts are met. The court is usually composed of three members. In the case of the water companies, one was chosen by the MWSS, one by the water companies, and one by the International Chamber of Commerce. The consumers do not have representation here. And considering how the MWSS has granted nearly every demands of the water companies, they have never behaved as representatives of the consumers.  </p>
<p>The arbitration court functioning outside of the country doesn’t feel the heat from the protesting locals. Through this body, the government who signed the onerous contract with the aggrieved big business can wash its hands off any decision that would further squeeze the consumers dry. And the big business gets what it wants in the end. It is win-win for all of them. The <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2013/07/12/with-concession-agreement-no-hope-maynilad-manila-water-will-voluntarily-lower-profits/">provision in the concession agreement</a>  allowing for international arbitration to settle problems in the implementation of the privatization deal – ‘problems’ such as consumers’ protests and even Supreme Court rulings in case the consumers secure an injunction — is clearly in the advantage of big businesses. </p>
<p>The latest rate hike approved by the MWSS for Maynilad and Manila Water is a solid, heavy punch to the consumers, as Teddy Casiño said in a gathering of SUKI early this month. But on top of that, he warned, there hangs over the consumers’ head the repercussions of an international arbitral court’s decision in favor of one of the water companies. It could mean more rate increases in the years to come. </p>
<p>“There is what we call <em>tubong lugaw</em> (literally profit as easy as cooking and selling porridge), and there is <em>tubong tubig</em> (profit from operating water companies), Casiño lamented. </p>
<p>Proofs are now staring us in the face that privatization is bad, very bad economics for the majority of the Filipino people. While the people are focused now, as if in an emergency, on the killings and the latest shocking cuss words of President Duterte and state security forces, the oligarchs he once badmouthed to court the masses are having a field day squeezing the same masses. </p>
<p>Since the privatization spree began under former President Fidel V. Ramos, the Filipinos have been steadily losing control of their water, electricity, telecommunications, roads and highways, railways, hospitals. Although the Filipinos have contributed in its construction, running, and upkeep, the Filipinos do not enjoy a share in the profits even in the form of improved and affordable services. On the contrary, every disaster and every needed expansion and improvement of the people’s original investments are being charged to the public, with interest, plus the 12-percent assured profit of the private concessionaires.</p>
<p>More of this privatization is happening under President Duterte. Nowadays the provincial water utilities are being privatized. The president of the Alliance for Consumer Protection says the utilities being transferred to private corporations are not even mismanaged or decrepit as was the usual excuse in previous privatization.</p>
<p>Following the privatization under Ramos, various administrations continued it, adding to BOT (Build-Operate-Transfer) their new names for privatization such as PPP (public-private partnership) and now, BBB (Build Build Build). In all, the Filipinos are made to shell out a huge amount of money to build a profit-generating vital installation that a private corporation operates for their own profits. Although the Filipinos pay and continue to pay in upkeep – like in the MRT – we are being made to pay increasing fares and not necessarily improving services.</p>
<p>As an advocate of fair electricity billing said in the same consumers’ gathering where Casiño discussed <em>tubong tubig</em>, “Privatization has created an intense way of squeezing the people.” He spoke of his group’s experience with the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC). They observed how the said government body has routinely failed to regulate the prices of electricity. “Our public officials are insensitive, thick in the face, and for that, the Filipinos are paying the price.” </p>
<p>All these sharing of updates on what’s happening now to previously publicly-owned utilities, and to some that are currently in the process of privatization, prompted calls for more united actions. As for the impending water rate hike, the government regulators are duty-bound to justify it first to the public. They can begin the process by sharing the documents and the basis they used to approve the hike. And then they can help address the calls to junk the concession agreement, or privatization deals, once and for all.   <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a>  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bulatlat-perspective.png"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bulatlat-perspective.png" alt="" width="140" height="101" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-104523" /></a></p>
<p>The recent incident of rape involving a member of the Philippine National Police (PNP) is enraging. But what is even more infuriating is the admission of PO1 Eduardo Valencia when he was presented to PNP Chief Director General Oscar Albayalde. To <a href="https://youtu.be/MoXk6cMUDrs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quote</a>, “<em>Sir, may pamilya po ako. Sir, hindi na po bago sa’ting mga operatiba ‘yung gano’n kapag may nahuhuli po tayong drug pusher, sir.</em>” (I have a family, sir. It is not new with our operatives when we arrest a drug pusher, sir.”</p>
<p>The victim is the 15-year old daughter of the spouse who was arrested by the police for alleged drug pushing. Based on the <a href="https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/philippine-daily-inquirer/20181101/281749860355764" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reports</a>, Valencia told the teenager that her parents would be cleared of charges if she agreed to be used. </p>
<p>Although higher ranks of the PNP vowed to give justice to the girl who tested positive for laceration, they also tried to downplay Valencia’s statement saying that accusations, such as rape, against the police are nothing new as it was only a “retaliation” by drug suspects who are arrested in the government’s anti-illegal drugs operation. </p>
<p>But a study of the Center for Women’s Resources (CWR), a 36-year old research and training institution for women, revealed that there are 56 policemen who were involved in 33 cases of violence against women. This was since President Duterte was elected, from July 2016 up to October 2018. </p>
<p>According to CWR, 12 of these cases are drug related, meaning, victims were either drug suspects, relatives of drug suspects, or were assaulted during drug-related operations. There were 16 cases of rape, while seven cases were acts of lasciviousness. Thirteen cases also involved victims who are minors.  </p>
<p>Instead of addressing this, <a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1048960/cops-involved-in-16-rape-cases-pnp-says-it-could-be-fake-news" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chief Supt. Benigno Durana Jr.</a>, PNP spokesperson resorted to discrediting the CWR, calling their data as fake news and riding on the rape incident even if the data was first released in July of this year – ahead of Valencia’s rape of the teenager. </p>
<p>No matter how the PNP tries to protect its name the fact still remains: that those who committed crimes were from within their ranks. </p>
<p>In the government’s so-called war on drugs, the PNP’s reputation dived to the lowest level. Thousands from the poor alleged of being drug pushers or users were killed without due process, their daughters raped, money being extorted in exchange for clearing their names. What could the powerless do if they are being threatened by the powerful? </p>
<p>Indeed, the war on drugs is not solving the problems plaguing our country. As Gabriela Women’s Party has said, the “incident confirms the institutionalized abuse of women and children within the PNP, with police officers using the fake war on drugs to prey on vulnerable targets.” </p>
<p>It only emboldens authorities to commit crimes against the people it should be protecting. </p>
<p>Ultimately, the culture of impunity under the Duterte administration reigns and intensifies. We heard many times over the news how he defended the police or any official from his wrongdoings and how he freed them from any accountability or even encouraged them to commit crimes.</p>
<p>Let us remember what he said:</p>
<p>“<em>Pag naka-rape ka ng tatlo, aminin ko na akin ‘yun.</em>” <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2017/05/30/womens-groups-chide-duterte-rape-no-laughing-matter/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Duterte said</a> addressing the 2nd Mechanized Infantry (Magbalantay) Brigade on May 26, 2017 after the implementation of martial law in Mindanao.  </p>
<p>“Shoot them in the vagina,” Duterte said referring to the <a href="http://politics.com.ph/walang-preno-duterte-tells-soldiers-shoot-female-npa-rebels-vagina-1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">female revolutionaries of the New People’s Army</a>. He said this in his speech in front of the reported rebel returnees at the Malacanang Palace. </p>
<p>Duterte also defended cops involved in the killing of Albuera Mayor Rolando Espinosa, Ozamiz City Mayor Reynaldo Parajinog, and the police arrest of tambays – all these without court due process.</p>
<p>Not only does the PNP take its cue from Duterte&#8217;s misogynistic remarks, what we are seeing is the use of rape as an instrument of the state against the poor. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a>  </p>

<p>The military and police are caught in their own web of lies. Armed Forces Chief of Staff General Carlito Galvez Jr.  <a href="https://news.mb.com.ph/2018/10/24/killing-of-sagay-9-connected-to-red-october-galvez/">claimed</a> that the Sagay massacre is connected  to the ”Red October” plot by the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army (CPP-NPA).     Just a week ago, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana <a href="https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/10/13/1859703/dnd-chief-lorenzana-no-more-red-october-plot">announced</a> that the military had neutralized the Red October plot, an alleged conspiracy to oust the Duterte presidency.  Now, it’s on again.</p>
<p>The Philippine National Police is echoing the <a href="https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2018/10/22/1862218/pnp-checking-red-involvement-killing-negros-sugar-workers">same line</a>, saying the NPA might be directly involved. And yet, Presidential Spokesman Salvador Panelo <a href="http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/10/22/pnp-negros-occidental-npa.html">alleged</a> that the National Federation of Sugar Workers (NFSW), to which the slain farmers belonged, is a front of the CPP-NPA. Panelo even insinuated the NPAs were the ones who killed their alleged recruits.   </p>
<p>The telenovela spin of state security forces never erases the fact that the Sagay massacre is yet another proof of the failure of government to render social justice to the tillers of the land. </p>
<p>Instead of admitting this failure, Agrarian Reform Secretary John Castriciones went on to <a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/10/22/18/slain-negros-farmers-were-not-land-redistribution-beneficiaries-says-dar">blame the victims</a>, saying they are not agrarian reform beneficiaries.  </p>
<p>The question is why are the victims not beneficiaries even as they have been tilling the 75-hectare Hacienda Nene for decades. </p>
<p>It turns out that the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) exempted Hacienda Nene from land reform coverage. Despite clamor from farmworkers, the DAR approved the landowners&#8217; deed of donation in 2014.</p>
<p>Most haciendas in Negros islands remain untouched. Data from <a href="http://www.dar.gov.ph/NIR">DAR-Negros Island</a> show that as of September 2016, more than 95,000 hectares have yet to be distributed under land reform. Ninety-nine percent of these lands are private agricultural lands.  </p>
<p>Moreover, an estimated 70 percent of sugar lands that were distributed have been leased to landlords due mainly to lack of support services and other support facilities, according to the NFSW. </p>
<p>The Unyon ng Manggagawa sa Agrikultura further revealed that of the 424,130 hectares of sugar lands in Negros Island, 40 percent are owned by only 1,860 big landlords and 30 percent are owned by just 6,820 big and small landlords. </p>
<p>It’s landlessness that spells hunger to Negros farm workers. To fight off hunger, thousands of farmworkers have resorted to <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/10/20/fighting-off-hunger-thousands-launch-collective-farming/"><em>bungkalan</em></a> or collective land cultivation since 2009.  With the increasing prices of basic commodities and their wages still a pittance, the NFSW has decided to expand their bungkalan campaign, with Hacienda Nene as one of the areas.</p>
<p>Then the tragedy happened. </p>
<p>Who is afraid of the collective action and unity of farm workers? Who has the intention of breaking the spirit of farm workers? </p>
<p>Following the massacre, Castriciones <a href="http://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2018/10/26/farmers-told-stop-land-grabbing/">called on</a> farmers to stop occupying private-owned lands.   </p>
<p>The chorus of Malacanang, military, police and DAR shows that they are justifying the attacks on farm workers and are hell bent on upholding the interests of landlords. </p>
<p>Now, who’s making the NPA and its agrarian revolution appealing to the poorest farmers? The government seems to be helping out its avowed enemies. The absence of social justice provides the fertile ground for revolution. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a>      </p>

Why are they fighting for their homes sitting on lands that are not theirs? Why can’t they follow the demolition notice? Why are they holding rallies? Why can’t they just look for jobs?</p>
<p>The list of questions can go on and on.</p>
<p>Upholding the so-called “rule of law,” for some, is the be-all and end-all of what it takes to fully transform this long-besieged country away from the widespread poverty and gross inequality. But last week, in a forum organized by the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyer, human rights lawyers have put a spotlight on the “rule of law,” where irony was ever present all throughout the day. After all, lawyers are expected to espouse and promote the so-called rule of law.</p>
<p>But how can one turn a blind eye on how the “rule of law” is being used as a tool of repression and fascism?</p>
<p>A glaring example is how the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law with a thrust of upholding the “rule of law” on one hand, while the other was busy committing countless human rights violations and pocketing billions of public funds.</p>
<p>Today, the very same “rule of law” is used to harass and deport Australian missionary nun Sr. Patricia Fox, citing that as a foreigner she should be banned from joining so-called political activities. Meanwhile, the United States continues to meddle in the country’s political, economic, and even military affairs while China destroys our reefs.</p>
<p>Still, the “rule of law” is used by the economic elite to control and monopolize resources while peasants are landless, urban poor are homeless, and workers are receiving a pittance. Rule of law, too, is used to impose heavy taxes on the suffering Filipino people while the very few rich are getting tax exemptions.</p>
<p>Just last week, government workers were banned from using their personal social media accounts to campaign for those vying for public office. Yet, the country’s top government official, no less than President Rodrigo Duterte, joined his aide who filed a certificate of candidacy and vowed to campaign for him.  </p>
<p>As a result of the people’s arduous struggle for change, there are laws that provide much-needed relief or somehow serve the interests of the marginalized. But these laws are often found in the backburner, without a single centavo to implement reforms it hope to see through as in the case of the Magna Carta on Health Workers.</p>
<p>Constitutional provisions that are deemed nationalist have yet to have enabling laws. And yet the present administration is already pushing to change it not for the country’s good but for their own political and economic ambitions. And let us not even get started on who crafts and passes the law. It deserves another piece.</p>
<p>The rule of law clearly bends, if not breaks or totally dissolve, for the ruler.</p>
<p>The call is clear: to confine oneself within the limits of the “rule of law” is a disservice to the country and its future generations. It is, too, an insult to those who have bravely challenged the then existing rule of law and fought for the rights and privileges we now enjoy.</p>
<p>As they say, don’t “follow all the rules and miss all the fun” of serving the Filipino people. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-104523" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/bulatlat-perspective.png" alt="" width="140" height="101" /></p>
<p>MANILA – If government troops want to prevent our youth from joining the CPP, they must refrain from pushing the youth into it. They should avoid at all costs to make it seem cool to join the likes of the CPP. They should try to really win their hearts and mind, and quit dictating let alone threatening them against which group they supposedly couldn’t ever join. Bar the youth from something and their first impulse will be to do what is expressly forbidden.</p>
<p>Anybody knows the youth are prone to rebelliousness. They like to question authorities; they dream big; they espouse idealisms for justice, and as most beauty contestants say, they crave peace and are eager to foster a better world for children. Do the Duterte government and its armed troops share that? Do their actions speak of that? Considering that the military claimed that more schools are perhaps producing CPP and NPA members and cadres now, including those not previously known for activism, UP Diliman Chancellor Michael Tan understated but concluded rightly that “it says something about the current government.”</p>
<p>That ‘something’ has to do with the Filipinos’ worsening hunger, joblessness, homelessness, vulnerability to disasters. All of these are traceable to the Duterte government’s policies. Just over two years in power, his policy “reforms” have resulted in a rice crisis, higher than usual inflation, mass evacuation, military strikes, police killings. Wages remain low. Workers remain contractuals. Farmers continue to call for land reform. Proven destructive mining operations continue. It’s only expected that the youth will protest this.</p>
<figure id="attachment_77845" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/by_raymund_cppanniv_1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-77845" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/by_raymund_cppanniv_1.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="400" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/by_raymund_cppanniv_1.jpg 640w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/by_raymund_cppanniv_1-584x365.jpg 584w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Raymund Villanueva (Bulatlat.com)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Government troops aim to decimate the CPP and the NPA soon. But more people seem to have been joining the CPP, if we are to believe the military’s growing list of schools, plantations and workplaces, and communities where the military has been pressuring the locals to “surrender.”</p>
<p>President Duterte knows first-hand the seductiveness and convincing power of talking about revolution and change. That’s exactly the costume and makeup he used when he campaigned for the presidency. Once in power, he practically admitted that what he promised during the campaign were different from what he is doing during his presidency. Why is the military wary of possible “plots” for Duterte’s ouster? If it is coming from the people, the military should know that it is a legitimate people’s exercise enshrined in the Constitution. The military should be defending the Constitution rather than an executive who rose to power based on false advertising. Why would the youth be inspired to abide by such a military or a president?</p>
<p>The Philippine military and police, to be true to its calling, should have been defending the land and seas of the country from foreign invaders. They should not be spending the people’s hard-earned money only to defend the few – the landlords, owners of businesses who have been causing the people’s misery. More so now that these wealthy few will pay fewer taxes thanks to TRAIN 2.</p>
<p>If the Duterte government wants, it could choose to win the hearts and minds of the youth away from the sway of the CPP by catering to the people’s demands. That’s what Duterte promised to do, after all.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_104048" style="width: 1064px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SUMADA-Asiddao.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-104048" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SUMADA-Asiddao.png" alt="Duterte" width="1064" height="798" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SUMADA-Asiddao.png 1064w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SUMADA-Asiddao-487x365.png 487w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SUMADA-Asiddao-768x576.png 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/SUMADA-Asiddao-840x630.png 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1064px) 100vw, 1064px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Will the youth follow such a leader? [Pre-SONA 2018 Photo by Arneth Asssidao / Bulatlat]</figcaption></figure>No matter how much the CPP tries to organize the youth, it could not have expanded its recruitment, as the military claims, if the youth sees no fertile ground to rebel.</p>
<p>Repressing and threatening the youth, or any activist and ordinary dissenting citizen for that matter, will not help the military or Duterte to counter ouster moves. Youth psychology and Philippine history suggest that the likes of Duterte or another nationwide Martial Law will peter out early, if it managed to get started.</p>
<p>As a youth leader from Southern Tagalog said last Sept 21, one of the differences between Martial Law in the time of Marcos and Martial Law now is that this time around, the CPP, with the Philippine government peace panel, have drafted and initialed concrete proposals to address the problems bedeviling the Filipinos. The CPP now has both the experience and concrete programs to bring change. Surely the military is not thinking of countering that by simply issuing threats, thwacking the whip for an impending crackdown, or deploying more military?</p>
<p>Marcos had done that and although the CPP had just started, too, at the time, Marcos was later unmasked and ousted while the CPP reported growing in size and stature.</p>
<p>Since Marcos, no dictator wanna-be has lasted in power as long as he did. GMA ruled the longest, less than 10 years. It wasn’t half as long as Marcos’ dictatorship. And now here’s Duterte, barely into his third year in Malacañang and already fending off calls for his ouster. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>
