				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">MANILA &#8212; Environment group Kalikasan People’s Network for the Environment warned against &#8220;a possible conflict of interest&#8221; in San Miguel Corporation’s (SMC) recent P1-billion partnership with the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). The green group likens it to a ‘soft payment’ to induce the government agency to fast track reclamation projects of SMC in Manila Bay.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“San Miguel’s P1-billion rehab is highly suspicious because it comes alongside its push for its Aerotropolis and Expressway-Dike reclamation projects across Northern Manila Bay,&#8221; said Leon Dulce, National Coordinator, Kalikasan People’s Network for the Environment (Kalikasan PNE).</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_106722" style="width: 735px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-106722" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bulacan_aerotropolis_direct_hit_onMap.jpg" alt="reclamation of Bulacan coasts" width="735" height="549" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bulacan_aerotropolis_direct_hit_onMap.jpg 735w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bulacan_aerotropolis_direct_hit_onMap-489x365.jpg 489w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bulakan fishing villages/areas to be &#8220;direct hit&#8221; of planned reclamation to pave way for San Miguel Corporations&#8217; airport, real estate, infrastructure projects (map lifted from Silvertides&#8217; presentation during a &#8220;public hearing&#8221; in an evacuation center in Bulakan, Feb 4, 2018.)</figcaption></figure><br />
SMC President and Chief Operating Officer Ramon S. Ang signed on March 4 a five-year agreement with DENR for a comprehensive dredging and clean-up program for the 59.25 kilometer Tullahan River.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We fear that it might serve as ‘greenwashing’ to cover up for SMC&#8217;s destructive projects, at best, or grease money for the railroading of reclamation at worst,” said Dulce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Since last year SMC is processing government  approval of its proposal to develop a 2,500-hectare Aerotropolis in Bulacan province worth P700 Billion. It also has a pending public-private partnership proposal, the Manila Bay Integrated Flood Control and Coastal Defense and Expressway Project, an expressway-dike which covers 18,000 hectares across the northern part of Manila Bay.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Kalikasan PNE said Silvertides Holdings Corporation, SMC’s contractor company for land acquisition, is suspected as responsible for clearing at least 657 mangrove trees in Bulakan municipality without securing an Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) and special tree cutting permit. The company recently claimed it will leave the existing 24.5-hectare mangrove eco-park in Bulakan undisturbed with the proposed construction of the Aerotropolis.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s easy to claim that the Aerotropolis will not affect mangrove parks and forests in Manila Bay but studies show otherwise. An ecosystem valuation case study in Manila Bay revealed how a land reclamation project complete with ecosystem conservation, buffering, and rehabilitation efforts could only generate only up to 49 percent of the area’s original ecosystem services,” explained Dulce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The environmental group challenged the SMC to prove its sincerity in contributing to the rehabilitation of Manila Bay &#8220;by desisting their reclamation projects in Bulacan.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“SMC’s P1-billion is chump change compared to the degree of environment destruction, loss of livelihood, and disaster risks that the Aerotropolis and the Expressway-Dike will cause in communities along Manila Bay” Dulce said.<a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MANILA &#8212; The National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) denounced the arrest of <em>Rappler</em> CEO Maria Ressa, branding it as &#8220;a shameless act of persecution by a bully government.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ressa was arrested by National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) agents around 5 p.m. today on cyber libel charges over a 2012 article published four months before the <a href="https://lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2012/ra_10175_2012.html">Cybercrime Prevention Act</a> was enacted.</p>
<p>In a statement signed by its National Directorate, the NUJP maintained that the Department of Justice &#8220;perverted the law by charging Maria for an offense allegedly committed before it actually became an offense under the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This government, led by a man who has proven averse to criticism and dissent, now proves it will go to ridiculous lengths to forcibly silence a critical media and stifle free expression and thought,&#8221; the NUJP said.</p>
<p>Arts and media alliance Let&#8217;s Organize for Democracy and Integrity (LODI) said that the charges are politically motivated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody believes for a single moment the concocted charges of tax evasion and foreign ownership. The truth is, the onion-skinned tyrant Duterte simply wants to shut down and punish both Maria and Rappler,&#8221; LODI said.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, Edre Olalia, president of the National Union of Peoples&#8217; Lawyers (NUPL) said the arrest of Ressa &#8220;over questionable charges that have been excavated are essentially undisguised attacks on press freedom and speech.&#8221;</p>
<p>In its statement, <em>Rappler</em> said, &#8220;This is a dangerous precedent that puts anyone – not just the media – who publishes anything online perennially in danger of being charged with libel. It can be an effective tool of harassment and intimidation to silence critical reporting on the part of the media. No one is safe.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Rappler</em> vowed to continue doing its job. &#8220;We will continue to tell the truth and report what we see and hear. We are first and foremost journalists, we are truthtellers, and we will not be intimidated.&#8221;</p>
<p>The NUJP called on all colleagues to resist &#8220;this blatant assault on our rights and liberties.&#8221;</p>
<p>For its part, LODI called on all freedom-loving Filipinos to stand with the independent Philippine press in defense of the rights not only of media but of the people. &#8220;For in suppressing the press it is the people&#8217;s right to know that is trampled on,&#8221; LODI said.</p>
<p>Olalia pointed out that the attacks on the Philippine media form part of Duterte&#8217;s repression. &#8220;Let there be no doubt about it: whether you are a senator, nun, lawyer, activist, human rights defender, or peace advocate, you will be in the crosshairs of government’s whole coercive apparatus if you dissent or criticize so good that they will make you look so bad,&#8221; he said.</p>

<em><a href="http://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA – A group of youth leaders, artists, and members of the academe called out former police chief and now senatorial aspirant Ronald Dela Rosa over his “joke” that one needs to kiss a Kapampangan to learn the language as he addressed the vote-rich province of Pampanga today, the first day of electoral campaign.</p>
<p>In his speech, Dela Rosa shared that a Kapampangan, which refers both to language and people who hailed from Pampanga province, turned him down during his days as a student of the Philippine Military Academy. This, he said, resulted to him not knowing how to speak the language.</p>
<p>“Passing this off as a joke and laughing matter further normalizes sexual harassment against women! Filipinos dont need an electoral candidate that has a foul mouth and disrepects women,” Kontra Bastos sa Eleksyon said in a Facebook post today, Feb. 12.</p>
<p>This, however, is not new these days. No less than President Rodrigo Duterte, himself, has been repeatedly assailed for his speeches, which his critics found misogynistic.</p>
<p>Dela Rosa is part of the 13-slate senatorial candidates of Hugpong ng Pagbabago, which was initiated by Duterte’s daughter and Davao city mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio.</p>
<p>He also served as the chief implementor of President Duterte’s war against illegal drugs, which killed about 20,000 suspected poor users and peddlers. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/08/28/kin-tokhang-victims-file-raps-vs-duterte-icc/">A charge in relation to the drug-related killing is currently pending before the prosecutor’s office of the International Criminal Court</a>. <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>&#8220;The person who pulled the trigger is not the only one at fault. The one who ordered the killing is equally guilty.&#8221; &#8212; Maria Kristina C. Conti, secretary general of the NUPL-NCR</p>
<p><strong>By ALYSSA MAE CLARIN</strong><br />
<em>Bulatlat.com</em></p>
<p>MANILA – The mother of a 17-year-old victim of a drug-related killing led the filing of charges today, Feb. 7, before the Office of the Ombudsman against suspected police officers implicated in the killing.</p>
<p>&#8220;My son is no criminal. They should not have killed a young man, who was full of dreams for his family,&#8221; said Christine Pascual, mother of 17-year-old Joshua Laxamana.</p>
<p>Laxamana was found dead on Aug. 21, 2018, his body riddled with bullets, in Rosales, Pangasinan.  </p>

<p>Murder charges were filed against Rosales Municipal Police chief Police Inspector John L. Corpuz and five other police officers: SPO3 Oliver A. Vingua, SPO1 Hilario T. Taquiqui Jr., PO2 Arvin G. Abella, PO2 Roy A. Sarmiento, and PO2 Ronald L. Casanero.</p>
<p>Dr. Adrian Arlie D. Guieb, who declared Joshua as dead on site, and eight other police officers were also among those charged for obstruction of justice.</p>
<p>In their petition, they also decried how the police crime laboratory office played a role in planting evidence against Joshua. Among those that they named are Police Inspectors Lady Ellen V. Maranion and Emeterio M. Macaraeg.</p>
<p>&#8220;The person who pulled the trigger is not the only one at fault. The one who ordered the killing is equally guilty,&#8221; said Maria Kristina C. Conti, secretary general of the NUPL-NCR.</p>
<p>Forensic pathologist Raquel Fortun conducted a re-autopsy of Laxamana&#8217;s body, as requested by the family. Result of the re-autopsy revealed that he did not fight back or “nanlaban” as claimed by the police. The injuries he sustained, the report said, were possibly “defense-type injuries.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laxamana said, &#8220;I thank all the people who supported my son, and hope that you will continue to fight with us from the filing, and until the end of the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rubilyn Litao, coordinator of Rise Up For Life and For Rights, a group of victims and families of President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on drugs, called on fellow advocates to remain vigilant in their efforts to seek justice, &#8220;Justice delayed and denied brings unimaginable agony for these families and will be a disservice to its duty to the people longing to live in peace and with dignity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Human rights and media groups estimate that at least 20,000 have been killed under Duterte’s war against drugs. <strong>(Bulatlat.com)</strong></p>

<p>MANILA &#8212; Alternative news website Bulatlat is once again being subjected to a series of cyber-attack, a digital forensic investigation report revealed.</p>
<p>In its forensic report, Qurium Media Foundation, a noted Sweden-based group of digital forensic investigation experts that provides support to various media agencies facing similar attacks, said they have been mitigating the attacks against Bulatlat’s website, which is being subjected to a series of denial of service attacks since January 19, 2019.</p>
<p>The attackers, the group said, attacked the old hosting&#8217;s “front-end at Cloudfare and later on they directed the attack to the hosting site,” using at least 1,100 compromised computers “to flood the website with requests.”</p>
<p>Qurium noted that the attackers are keeping a low request per ration “to avoid flood detection.”</p>

<p>The cyber-attack has repeatedly brought down the website for several days. Qurium had to migrate the website in the middle of an ongoing attack.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Bulatlat has been subjected to such cyber-attack. On Dec. 26, Bulatlat’s website, along with other alternative news agencies, were also down due to an apparent similar attack.</p>
<p>In an earlier statement, Bulatlat said that the attack is yet another attempt to infringe on press freedom. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>MANILA &#8212; Lawmakers have once again ignored the strong outcry to put a stop to the proposed bill that aims to lower the minimum age of criminal responsibility as they railroaded its approval on its second reading before the plenary of the House of Representatives on Jan. 23.</p>
<p>In a statement, Gabriela Women’s Party said its approval pushed through despite objections from the floor by several lawmakers who were against the proposed law. </p>
<p>“The House leadership pulled the strings to close the curtain on the period of interpellation and debate &#8212; despite the fact that the bill&#8217;s sponsor has failed to convincingly and substantially explain the rationale for rushing the measure. This is a cowardly act to constrict the space for legislative scrutiny of the patently insane measure,” the women’s group said. </p>

<p>In the midst of such strong public outcry, former president now House Speaker Gloria Macapagal Arroyo said in her media interviews that she supported the proposed law to lower the minimum age of criminal responsibility because the “President wants it.” Among those who have strongly assailed the moves to lower the minimum age of criminal responsibility are various human rights and child rights advocacy groups, lawyers, and even local celebrities. </p>
<p>Lawmakers, however, have already backed down from their earlier stance that the minimum age of criminal responsibility must be at 9 years old. On the second reading, they have agreed to make it 12, short of three years to the current age of criminal liability and is the same as stipulated in the Senate counterpart of the bill. </p>
<p>“How can the government be so hell-bent at lowering the minimum age for criminal responsibility but so vague at ensuring child rehabilitation and youth support programs and facilities, more so in addressing poverty? There is no substance in the defense that children will not be jailed and that they will be rehabilitated because existing facilities do not even meet the requirements of the law,” Gabriela Women’s Party said.<a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>MANILA – Workers, public transport drivers, families of migrant workers and informal workers from urban poor communities trooped to COMELEC today to demand that Manggagawa Partylist be allowed to run in the coming mid-term elections.</p>
<p>COMELEC decided last year December 19 to dismiss the appeal of Manggagawa for accreditation as a party-list organization. But a copy of the decision reached the officers of the Manggagawa Partylist only on January 14, 2019. The group has been following up on the decision since December. </p>
<p>On January 19, they filed a petition at the Supreme Court questioning the COMELEC decision to disqualify the workers&#8217; partylist. They asked the Supreme Court to issue a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order on the COMELEC’s decision.</p>
<p>“While we are waiting for the deliberation of the Supreme Court on the petition that we filed, we are urging our Justices to tell COMELEC to still include Manggagawa Party List in the official list of candidates and be included in the ballots,” said Elmer “Bong” Labog, National President and First Nominee of the MANGGAGAWA Partylist.</p>
<p>The COMELEC decision stems from the Manggagawa Partylist&#8217;s failure to state that it is not funded by the government. But the MANGGAGAWA Partylist said they stated in their Petition and Motion for Reconsideration that they do not receive any funds from the government.</p>
<p>“As the COMELEC can see, the members of our organizations belong to the marginalized and underrepresented sectors of our society. Our nominees are legitimate leaders of people’s organizations from trade unions, urban poor, jeepney drivers, OFWs and their families. Our organizations have been at the forefront of the workers’ fight against contractualization, against oil price increases, against demolition of urban poor communities, for higher wages, and for protection and services to our OFWs,” said Labog.</p>
<p>MANGGAGAWA Partylist was established with the support of Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU), Pinagkaisang Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operator Nationwide (PISTON), Migrante, and Kalipunan ng mga Damayang Mahihirap (KADAMAY). Its nominees came from leaders of these organizations.</p>
<p>“The organizations and members comprising the Manggagawa Partylist show all are legitimate people’s and grassroots organizations. It is the clear proof that our Partylist represents the marginalized and underrepresented sectors and that we do not receive Government funds. Instead of allowing genuine partylists to run in the elections, the COMELEC has been accrediting “bogus or fake” partylists who are linked to well-entrenched political dynasties, special business interests and who have questionable advocacies,” lamented Labog.</p>
<p>The disqualification of the Manggagawa Partylist has shown again the loopholes of the current partylist system, where the real marginalized and underrepresented continue being marginalized. Labog said that while they are being pushed out, the &#8216;partylists&#8217; of political dynasties are freely being allowed to run. Combined with the loopholes, the COMELEC has been enabling the abuse of these loopholes throughout the years, Labog added.</p>
<p>During the picket in front of the COMELEC, the supporters of Manggagawa Partylist urged the COMELEC to immediately act toward ensuring the main objective of the partylist system is being met. The partylist system, they said, is supposed to expand political participation of the marginalized sectors. </p>
<p>Labog warned that if the COMELEC did not in favor of the Partylist system&#8217;s objectives, they will make sure the COMELEC will be held accountable for its part in &#8220;bastardizing the Partylist system.” </p>
<p>In other parts of the country, members and supporters of Manggagawa Partylist also held a picket urging the COMELEC to let their partylist run this coming elections. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>MANILA – Youth and children rights groups said the new efforts that seek to lower down the criminal liability of children from 15 to nine years old is a “state abandonment” as most children in conflict with the law belong to poor families who are in need of due social services.</p>
<p>“The proposed legislation aims nothing but to put the blame on children in conflict with the law and punish them behind bars,” said children’s group Salinlahi Alliance for Children’s Concerns in a statement.</p>
<p>The Minimum Age of Criminal Responsibility refers to the lowest age at which a child may be prosecuted within the Philippine criminal justice system.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2011/11/04/lowering-age-discernment-wont-solve-juvenile-delinquency-childrens-rights-groups/"><strong>Read: ‘Lowering age discernment won’t solve juvenile delinquency’ – children’s rights groups</strong></a></p>
<p>At present, the Republic Act No. 9344 or the Juvenile Justice and Welfare Act of 2006 provides that children below 15 years old exempted from criminal liability but will be subjected to an intervention program, such as a child-caring institution under the Social and Welfare department, while those between 15 and 18 years old are to be sent to a youth center and go through rehabilitation programs.</p>
<p>News reports said lawmakers are expected to hold a hearing on Monday, Jan. 21, to repeal the present law.</p>

<p>As most belong to poor and low-earning families, Salinlahi said children in conflict with the law are victims of poverty, hunger, social inequality, and state neglect. The group said that of the two percent reported crimes committed by children from 2006 to 2012, about 47 percent were against property, such as petty theft and robbery.</p>
<p>In a statement, the United Nations Children’s Fund said the children in conflict with the law are “already victims of circumstance. Instead of lowering down the minimum age of criminal responsibility, the UN body called on lawmakers to focus on improving the implementation of the present law.  <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>MANILA – A Quezon City court dismissed today, Jan. 15, the charges against National Democratic Front of the Philippines consultant Rafael Baylosis for insufficiency of evidence, his lawyers from the Public Interest Law Center said in a statement.</p>
<p>Rachel Pastores, managing counsel of the PILC, said, “The decision penned by Judge Editha G. Miña-Aguba pointed out the incredulity of the police narrative of the surveillance and arrest, saying: for &#8216;evidence to be believed, it must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness but it must be credible in itself, such as the common experience and observation of mankind can approve as probable under the circumstances.&#8217;”</p>
<p>Baylosis, who was arrested on Jan. 31, 2018 along with companion Roque Guillermo Jr., was among those nabbed after President Rodrigo Duterte declared an end to peace talks with the NDFP, where he is a consultant for both social and economic reforms and political and constitutional reforms – two substantive agenda in the peace negotiations.</p>
<p>Three more peace consultants were arrested after him and remain incarcerated to this day. They are Adelberto Silva, Vicente Ladlad, and Rey Claro Casambre.</p>
<p>“The dismissal of the case not only vindicates Baylosis, who has always asserted his innocence; it also exposes how the police carry out illegal actions – vilification, undue surveillance, illegal arrest, planting of evidence, and filing of trumped-up charges – against peace consultants and political activists,” Pastores said.</p>
<p><strong>READ: <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/02/02/illegal-arrest-ndfp-peace-consultant-follows-unbelievably-bad-script/">‘Illegal arrest of NDFP peace consultant follows an unbelievably bad script’</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>‘More imagined than real’</strong></p>
<p>In the court decision, Judge Aguba noted the inconsistencies and contradictory individual claims of arresting police officers in their respective testimonies, such as their distance from Baylosis when they noticed a firearm purportedly tucked at the peace consultant’s waist.</p>
<p>“Either way, it was improbable for him to see, even with his perfect vision, what he declared he had seen at 3 o’clock in the afternoon,” the court decision read, adding that what they saw may be “more imagined than real.”</p>
<p>By this alone, the court decision further added, “the cases are dismissible.”</p>
<p>“It is settled that an evidence to be believed must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness but it must be credible itself, such as the common experience and observation of mankind can approve as probable under the circumstances,” the decision read.</p>
<p>Pastores said “Baylosis’s defense poked holes into their story, pointed out not only lapses but grievous procedural mistakes, and thus exposed concerted, malicious efforts to fabricate the charges.”</p>
<p>NDFP Negotiating Panel chairperson Fidel Agcaoili told <em>Bulatlat</em> that he welcomes the court decision, adding that &#8220;it shows that there are GRP judges who respect their own laws and would not kowtow to the filing of trumped-up charges by the military and police.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Filing of countercharges</strong></p>
<p>In a message sent to <em>Bulatlat </em>, Baylosis’s daughter Eleanor de Guzman welcomed the court decision, adding that there should be “no other hindrance to his father&#8217;s liberty.”</p>
<p>De Guzman said her family has always been confident that the charges filed against her father will be dismissed as the witnesses presented against him “could only tell lies and their testimonies are riddled with inconsistencies.”</p>
<p>The Coalition for the Defense and Freedom of Rafael Baylosis, she added, is planning to file countercharges against those behind her father’s incarceration. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>The attacks against the Catholic Church are not &#8220;out of concern or just personal rancor&#8221; but to stop the &#8220;people from uniting and putting an end to his wicked and bloodthirsty puppet regime&#8221; as church workers are working on uniting the Filipinos to “wield their collective power to gain collective good.”</p>
<p><strong>By JANESS ANN J. ELLAO</strong><br />

<p>MANILA &#8212; A priest turned revolutionary said the escalating tirades of President Rodrigo Duterte are calculated to quell the growing resistance of the Filipino people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Confronted with the growing wrath of the people and excoriated as an international pariah for his wanton rights violations, Mr. Duterte is desperately aware of the Church’s moral suasion that could back a broad united front and sway the widely Catholic population against his tyrannical rule,&#8221; the open letter of Fr. Santiago Salas of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines – Eastern Visayas read.</p>
<p>Duterte, who has been consistently criticizing the Catholic Church and threatening its leaders, recently said that bystanders should steal or kill from rich bishops, prompting a reaction from Balanga Bishop Ruperto Santos who said in his radio interview that the present administration &#8220;is disappointment and disgrace to our country.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Church has been vocal about Duterte’s policies, most especially on his bloody war against drugs, which critics said only targeted the poor. Human rights defenders estimated that more than 20,000 have been killed.</p>
<p>In his open letter that circulated in social media, the Fr. Salas said being a priest himself, he has witnessed the “faults” of the Church but added that it is through “going outside an elegant edifice of marble and gold and linking with the people that our faith becomes truly alive and relevant.”</p>
<p>He also added that attacks against the Catholic Church are not said &#8220;out of concern or just personal rancor&#8221; but to stop the &#8220;people from uniting and putting an end to his wicked and bloodthirsty puppet regime&#8221; as church workers are working on uniting the Filipinos to “wield their collective power to gain collective good.”</p>
<p>Fr. Salas said, “the people are suffering now more than ever, and to the church the voice of the people is the voice of God: They must be heeded.” <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>
