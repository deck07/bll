<p>TRAIN-2 worsens the regressiveness of the tax system on top of what TRAIN-1 has done by reducing corporate income tax collections to increase corporate profits &#8230; The fiscal incentives scheme should most of all be grounded in a strategic vision of national industrialization. </p>
<p><strong>by SONNY AFRICA</strong><br />
<strong><a href="https://ibon.org/">ibon.org</a></strong></p>
<p>The Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion Package 2 (TRAIN-2) recently passed by the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives (HOR) increases corporate profits at the expense of Filipinos. TRAIN-2 was renamed Tax Reform for Attracting Better and High-Quality Opportunities (TRABAHO) to distance itself from the controversial TRAIN-1, but it is very much a twin measure to TRAIN-1 in the Duterte administration&#8217;s scheme to craft a tax system that favors the rich at the expense of the poor.</p>
<p><strong>TRABAHO = TRAIN-2</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>The centerpiece tax change of TRAIN-2 is to reduce the corporate income tax (CIT) rate from the current 30 percent to 20 percent by 2029.</p></blockquote>
<p> This is done in stages starting from a cut to 28 percent in 2021 with a two (2) percentage point cut every other year until it reaches 20 percent in 2029. The Department of Finance (DOF) reportedly estimates a CIT revenue loss of Php62 billion just in 2021, corresponding to an increase in corporate profits by that same amount. Note that CIT collection reached Php534 billion in 2016 mostly paid by large corporations and not micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs).</p>
<p>This CIT cut in TRAIN-2 is a parallel measure to the significant personal income tax (PIT) cuts benefiting mostly higher-income families in TRAIN-1. Thus, this also means that the resulting revenue losses are in effect made up for by taxing consumption including by the poor.</p>
<p>Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) collections consist of direct and indirect taxes. Direct taxes are progressive because they are imposed on individuals and corporations according to their wealth, income, or property. CIT, PIT, estate and donor taxes are the most important direct taxes. Indirect taxes meanwhile are generally regressive because they are imposed on transactions heedless of the wealth, income, or property of the individual or entity involved. Value-added tax (VAT) and excise taxes are the most important indirect taxes.</p>
<p>In 2015, the BIR&#8217;s tax collection consisted of corporate income taxes (34 percent), individual income taxes (21 percent), other income taxes (3 percent), VAT (21 percent), excise taxes (11 percent), and percentage and other taxes (10 percent). TRAIN then in effect erodes at least 55 percent of the BIR&#8217;s revenue base consisting of the corporate and individual income taxes.</p>
<blockquote><p>TRAIN-2 worsens the regressiveness of the tax system on top of what TRAIN-1 did by reducing CIT collections to increase corporate profits. </p></blockquote>
<p>At the heart of TRAIN&#8217;s tax reforms are huge cuts in direct taxes especially on CIT and PIT and also in estate and donor taxes. This will increase the wealth, income and property of the rich. The Duterte administration compensates for the revenue losses from those tax cuts by indirect taxes which tax consumption including by the poor – regardless of their lack of wealth, income, and property.</p>
<p>To illustrate, TRAIN-1 lowers PIT, estate taxes and donor taxes paid by the country’s richest families by a total of Php199.3 billion in 2021; this is more money in their pockets. TRAIN-2 cuts corporate income taxes by Php62 billion in 2021; this is more money in their bank accounts. This is a total Php261.3 billion revenue loss from cuts in direct taxes.</p>
<p>TRAIN makes up for these revenue losses, among others, Php215.6 billion in additional taxes paid by consumers on oil and sugar-sweetened beverages under TRAIN-1 in 2021. A portion of these consumption taxes are paid by the rich but they are able to offset this with their gains from the direct tax cuts. But the country&#8217;s poorest, who can ill afford any income losses from having so little as it is, have to pay higher consumption taxes and suffer higher inflation without any offsetting benefits from cuts in direct taxes.</p>
<p>TRAIN&#8217;s erosion of the government&#8217;s revenue base in corporations and wealthy families is grossly insensitive to current country conditions.</p>
<p><strong>More tax cuts for the rich</strong></p>
<p>Income and wealth are distributed very unevenly with a few extremely rich families, a narrow middle class, and huge poverty for the majority with varying degrees of vulnerability. Out of some 23 million Filipino families, the country&#8217;s richest 550,000 families or top 2.4 percent have annual family incomes of at least Php1 million to even 100 million pesos or more. Next is a middle class of around 4.1 million or some 18 percent of families with annual incomes from a lower middle class of Php365,000 to an upper middle class of up to Php1 million. These income figures do not capture accumulated assets and wealth which are actually distributed even more unevenly.</p>
<p>The overwhelming number of those 20 percent or so higher-income families are the biggest beneficiaries from the PIT cuts of TRAIN-1. As provided by the TRAIN-1 law, the income taxes they pay will be reduced in 2018-2022 and then reduced further in 2023.</p>
<p>The lowest income 18.1 million or 80 percent families, meanwhile, have annual incomes of at most Php365,000 to as low as a miserable Php17,300 or even less. A huge number of these families are low-earning and in the informal sector. The structure of the economy also has to be considered. There is a large agricultural sector with much activity beyond the tax system and at any rate is still quite backward. There are also very many informal and small-scale enterprises not just in agriculture but also in industry and services.</p>
<p>The situation of gross inequity immediately points to how the rich should be taxed more heavily than the poor. They can afford to pay much more taxes than they do without in any way diminishing the level of welfare of their families and even of their future generations. The informality and small scale of so many enterprises meanwhile point to how high-earning large corporations are an important revenue base. They can afford to pay taxes especially considering how many, through a host of legal and illegal devices, are actually paying much less corporate income tax than the 30 percent nominal rate.</p>
<p>The corporations of the country&#8217;s 16 richest oligarchs – covering SM Investments Corp, SM Prime Holdings, JG Summit Holdings, Aboitiz Equity Ventures, LT Group Inc, GT Capital Holdings, Ayala Corp, Ayala Land, ICTSI, DMCI Holdings, Alliance Global Holdings (AGI), Cosco Capital Inc, Vista Land, Coyuito Group of Companies, Filinvest Devt Corp, and Top Frontier Investment Holdings – each make tens of billions of pesos in profit every year.</p>
<p>IBON&#8217;s initial estimates, however, find that the effective tax rate (ETR) of individual corporations varied widely from as low as 12.2 percent (JG Summit) to 25.9 percent (Ayala Land). Worse, they cumulatively only paid an ETR of 20 percent on their combined income. This is much less than the supposed 30 percent corporate income tax rate.</p>
<blockquote><p>Looked at regionally, with TRAIN-2 the Duterte administration gleefully participates in a race-to-the-bottom with other governments in Southeast Asia to give foreign investors the most favorable tax environment for increasing their profits.</p></blockquote>
<p> Yet foreign investors have never been for development and have always been, and always will be, for themselves. Foreign manufacturers are for instance already the biggest investors in the country yet the share of Filipino manufacturing of the economy is likely its smallest in history.</p>
<p><strong>Incentivizing development</strong></p>
<p>The reforms in fiscal incentives under TRAIN-2 in a way serve the same purpose as the temporary unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) for the poorest 10 million families of TRAIN-1. They are both smokescreens to divert from how the Duterte administration is making the tax system even more pro-rich and anti-poor than it already is.</p>
<p>Reforms in fiscal incentives are necessary especially to take away the redundant incentives and hidden subsidies that the DOF has been pointing out. Only a few benefit as it is with apparently just 2,844 firms availing of incentives out of almost a million enterprises (915,726) of all sizes in the country. The proposed criteria for assessing the performance of recipients of incentives are however insufficient.</p>
<p>According to the DOF, TRAIN-2 works on the general principle that the incentives will be performance-based. This is understood in terms of investments, job creation, exports, countryside development, and research and development. The incentives will also be targeted as specified by the Investment Priorities Plan (IPP). These parameters are however not enough for assessing contributions to national development.</p>
<p>The fiscal incentives scheme should most of all be grounded in a strategic vision of national industrialization. This means developing Filipino industry that harnesses Philippine human and natural resources for national development, and should not be confused with foreign transnational corporations (TNCs) and manufacturers merely located in the country. </p>
<blockquote><p>Foreign firms do not augment Filipino industrial capacity and, if anything, they are averse to this because that just means competition for them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Enterprises applying for incentives should be assessed according to how far they build national industrial capacity in terms of: increasing Filipino firms&#8217; productivity and value-added; promoting domestic linkages with other Filipino producers and service-providers; and generating employment on a wide scale. Agricultural and rural development is also important but needs to be framed according to the wider context of advancing national industrialization.</p>
<p>In practice, this means that incentives should be given to firms that increase opportunities for Filipinos by: sourcing locally from Filipino enterprises; developing or transfer production and other technologies for Filipino firms; prioritizing and training local hires; and setting up joint ventures between foreign capital and Filipinos. Incentives to encourage sustainable production technologies and environmentally-friendly production processes are also important and have long-term development benefits.</p>
<p>Without establishing and operationalizing such parameters, any supposed reforms in fiscal incentives are really no reform at all. These will just result in the same sort of service-dominated economy with shallow foreign-dominated manufacturing that exists today. So-called accelerated growth and inclusiveness will also just be mere rhetoric.</p>
<p><strong>TRAIN delusions</strong></p>
<p>Pres. Rodrigo Duterte made a pitch for TRAIN-2 in his last state of the nation address in July 2018. he dutifully repeated what must have been fed him by his economic managers: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The enactment of the Package 2 is what stands between today and millions of jobs in the near future.&#8221; TRAIN-2 does no such thing.</p></blockquote>
<p>As it is, foreign and domestic corporations are already sitting on hundreds of billions in pesos in profits and all TRAIN-2 does is give them more money. TRAIN-1 was the Duterte administration&#8217;s &#8220;biggest Christmas and New Year&#8217;s gift&#8221; to wealthy families and to themselves last year. TRAIN-2 is set to become the same to foreign TNCs and oligarch corporations this year. <strong><em>Reposted by</em></strong> <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>At one point during his interrogation, he was made to strip naked and face his armed interrogators in a room chilled by air conditioning and an industrial fan.</p>
<p><strong>By MARYA SALAMAT</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA – Jerome Aladdin Succor Aba, 25, vice chairperson of Sandugo – Movement of Moro and Indigenous Peoples for Self-Determination – flew to the United States on April 17 for meetings with Filipino communities and human rights advocates. He would have stayed for these activities for a few weeks. But even as he holds a 10-year multiple entry US visa, the US Customs Border and Protection agents said <a href="http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/04/18/filipino-activist-detained-at-airport-for-removal-from-u-s/">he had “a technical glitch” </a>on his visa.</p>
<p>Based on Aba’s ordeal at the hands of immigration agents in the Philippines and the US, the so-called glitch in his visa was likely caused by the US-led “war on terror,” the blue print of the Philippine military’s counterinsurgency war, aerial bombings, and extra-judicial killings. The killings and harassments of people due to this war in the Philippines have been keeping human rights advocates and Moro leaders like Aba busy. But the Philippine government, having aligned itself with the US in  waging this war on terror, has been vilifying legal and progressive activists such as Aba as “terrorist.” The US war on terror is a borderless war aiming to maintain US hegemony. It prepositions US troops and equipment and uses the troops of “allies” such as the governments of its former colonies like the Philippines.</p>
<p>Aba believes his involvement in human rights work in the Philippines is the main reason he was deported. But not before he was detained, interrogated, threatened and tortured first in a US international airport.</p>
<p>“With the Trump administration thriving on misinformation and falsehoods, there is no place for me shedding light on the US’ hand in the destruction of Marawi and the ongoing ‘war on terror’against my Moro and Lumad brothers in Mindanao. This US ‘war on terror’ led to the killings of civilians, forced evacuation due to aerial bombings in communities, and has reinforced Islamophobia,” Aba wrote in his statement after arriving back in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Various groups are now urging the Philippine government to lodge protests with the US regarding the detention, harassment and torture, and violation of Aba’s other rights including his right to a legal counsel while being interrogated. What Aba suffered in the US may hint of similar restrictions in movement, association and speech of other freedom-loving Filipinos and citizens.</p>
<p>Even as Aba was being held against his will, questioned and threatened by armed US personnel, the US Embassy in Manila was announcing the start of activities for the 34<sup>th</sup> Balikatan war exercises.</p>
<p>The US government and military have been training Philippine armed forces and the police, sharing information and boosting what it calls as their interoperability.</p>
<p>Yearly, “US and PH military <a href="https://ph.usembassy.gov/balikatan-34/">demonstrate in Balikatan exercises</a> the cooperation and interoperability between the U.S. and Philippines, consistent with the Mutual Defense Treaty and Visiting Forces Agreement,” the US Embassy in Manila said on Aril 19.</p>
<p>“To improve their ability to coordinate a multilateral response to crisis, the two militaries will continue their commitment to train and share information,” the US Embassy also said.</p>
<p>What happened to Aba also followed the recent <a href="https://ph.usembassy.gov/us-homeland-security-investigations-trains-philippine-national-police-officers-united-states/">training provided by the US Homeland Security Investigations</a> to Philippine police officers.</p>
<p>The US Homeland Security Investigations and instructors of Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) “led rigorous sessions” on entry and defensive tactics, investigative techniques, interviews and interrogations, evidence collection, surveillance, and undercover operations. The participants in the training were officers of the newly-formed Philippine Transnational Criminal Investigative Unit (TCIU).</p>
<p>It is instructive that Jerome Aba was twice held up by the Philippine immigration personnel at the NAIA before he was allowed to board the plane on April 17.</p>

<p><strong>A struggle against the US-led war on terror in Ph and US</strong></p>
<p>From the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila to the San Francisco International Airport in California, Aba was questioned about the purpose and activities of his US visit. “Will you be joining rallies there?” Aba was asked several times in Manila.</p>
<p>He arrived in San Francisco and before long, he faced US interrogators who already had compiled a thick stack of documents about him.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/04/25/muslim-human-rights-worker-mindanao-not-terrorist/">Aba’s recollection</a> of what transpired, the US Homeland Security and Customs Border and Protection agents treated him as a “terrorist,” forcing him to admit it in over 24 hours of interrogation under different agents in different rooms inside the San Francisco International Airport.</p>
<p>“Aba got a taste of some of the US military’s interrogation and torture technics reportedly being used in Guantanamo,” Cristina Palabay, secretary general of human rights group Karapatan, said at the first press conference where Aba shared what happened to him.</p>
<p>Aba recalled that he was taken out of the passengers’ line to the immigration and handcuffed. The US Homeland Security or Customs Border and Protection agents deprived him of his computer, cellphone, and luggage. They forced open his computer and cellphone and searched through his luggage. To his protestations and demands for a legal counsel, he was repeatedly told he has no rights. He was told the Universal declaration of rights did not cover him where he was. Five burly men would escort him when he needed to go to the men’s room.</p>
<p>It was approximately after around 24 hours into his detention and interrogation that Aba was first asked about what food he eats. Despite stressing he’s a Moro and he doesn’t eat pork, he was given a ham sandwich. “The tools of repression by the state can look so mundane,” he would write a few days later in his social media account.</p>
<p>At one point during his interrogation, he was made to strip naked and face his armed interrogators in a room chilled by air conditioning and an industrial fan.</p>
<p>Twice, he recalled being left alone in what looked like a deserted office, with a gun left lying around, at first, and the next time, a grenade and a cellphone. Aba purposely did not touch the weapons. “What did they hope to see me do? Kill myself? Start shooting at them?” he asked the media.</p>
<p>One of the interrogators called Lopez appeared to Aba as so riled up and paranoid that his hands would often reach for his gun if Aba moved a little while under questioning.</p>
<p>Aba noted that his behavior &#8212; ignoring the weapons left lying around, insisting he has rights &#8212; only seemed to infuriate the interrogators who kept accusing him, and forcing him to admit, that he is a “terrorist” or in league with “terrorists.”</p>
<p>As supposed proof, his interrogators presented Aba with a stack of papers about him. They showed his pictures with alleged “terrorists.” The US interrogators labeled the Moro Islamic Liberation Front peace panel chair Mohagher Iqbal and former Bayan Muna Rep. Satur Ocampo as “terrorists.” Aba replied that these two were not terrorists but are in fact working for peace.</p>
<p><strong>Silencing truth</strong></p>
<p>Various groups condemned the terrorist tagging and inhumane treatment of Aba.</p>
<p>&#8220;The US and PH governments want to terrorize dissent and keep the desecration of the country under wraps,” said Kabataan Partylist Rep. Sarah Elago. Bayan Muna filed a resolution in Congress seeking investigation and justice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jerome-and-kerlan.jpg"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jerome-and-kerlan.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-102933" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jerome-and-kerlan.jpg 640w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jerome-and-kerlan-487x365.jpg 487w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Aba has a lot to say to his countrymen and friends of the Filipino people in the US about the Duterte government’s killings and the role of the US-instigated war on terror. He said the brazen attacks on the people and their rights are being executed to protect the interests of big US corporations.</p>
<p>Amid the Philippine government’s intensified militarization of Mindanao, it opened vast lands of Mindanao, including the territories of the Bangsamoro and ancestral domains of the indigenous people, to exploitation and plunder by companies such as Dole, Unifrutti, and Del Monte, Aba said.</p>
<p>Aba expressed gratitude for “the untiring protest actions” mounted by friends and organizations from all over the USA- from Portland to New York City.</p>
<p>“Your quick response to my situation, such as the rally at San Francisco Airport and call barrage, has helped tremendously in my release from the cruel clutches of the CBP and Homeland Security,” Aba said.</p>
<p>In the face of increased military responses to people’s resistance, Aba urged the public to help spread “the truth the US government wants to hide from the American people and the whole world.”</p>
<p>Amid Martial Law in Mindanao, Aba said a million hectares are being encroached on and operated by foreign mining businesses and 500,000 hectares by plantations. Also, a million hectares are reserved for the expansion of oil palm plantations by 2020. In Marawi where the US and the Philippines maintain military facilities, the current rehabilitation plan being discussed includes expanding the military reservation.</p>
<p>The US is also expanding its military bases in the Philippines. On April 17, the same day Aba was being detained in the US as an alleged “terrorist,” US Ambassador Sung Y. Kim and Defense Sec. Delfin N. Lorenzana were holding a groundbreaking ceremony for the first major project under the “Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA)” in Cesar Basa Air Base, Pampanga. Four others are in the pipeline. <a href="https://ph.usembassy.gov/enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement-groundbreaking-ceremony/">https://ph.usembassy.gov/enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement-groundbreaking-ceremony/</a></p>

<p>“We welcome Duterte’s vow to stop contractualization. We have yet to see him keep his promise.”</p>
<p><strong>By MARYA SALAMAT</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em> </p>
<p>MANILA – The incoming Duterte administration has been laying the groundwork for tackling contractualization, the employment setup that became a hot election issue last May and one where Duterte led the presidentiables in unequivocally promising to end it. A week before his inauguration, his economic team especially his Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello said they have been given the marching order to work on it, but based on reports these past two weeks, it is apparently working with lower assumption of the extent of contractual-like non-regular work. There are more contractuals or non-regulars than highlighted in findings of government surveys. <strong>(Read: <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2016/06/29/aquinos-legacy-proliferation-of-contractual-seasonal-low-quality-jobs/" target="_blank">Aquino’s legacy| Proliferation of contractual, seasonal, low-quality jobs</a>)</strong></p>
<p>Duterte’s economic team is also making careful steps around his vow against contractualization, as they are smoothing it out first with the business sector beginning this Tuesday in a consultative meeting in Davao City. This, amid the World Bank’s country representative’s caution against scrapping or abolishing contractualization.</p>
<p>In Davao City where President-elect Duterte hailed, two of his children who were voted as Mayor and Vice-Mayor, are seen as siding with investors in the ongoing strike of fruit workers over contractualization. Davao City Mayor Sarah Duterte’s husband is lawyer of Japanese-owned Nakashin fruit company, an employer of longtime contractuals now on strike. After Duterte’s son, Davao City vice-mayor Paolo Duterte, failed to broker a deal between the workers who are demanding reinstatement as regular workers, and the Japanese capitalist who is demanding the end of strike without following through on his early promise to reinstate and regularize them by batches, Davao City Vice Mayor Duterte asked the President-elect this week not to push through with appointing as Labor Undersecretary Joel Maglungsod, former Anakpawis Partylist Representative and long-time labor leader with the KMU. </p>
<p>Given all these, will the incoming Duterte administration genuinely end or make a dent toward lessening contractualization? Or will his economic team end up like the outgoing Aquino administration that had claimed to want to end contractualization, yet issued an order that labor groups say legitimizes contractualization? </p>
<p><strong>Floodgates of contractualization: the distinction between allowable and not</strong></p>
<p>“The distinction between ‘core’ and ‘non-core’ aspects of a company’s business – like the Labor Department’s distinction between ‘legitimate’ and ‘fly-by-night’ contractors, the Labor Code’s distinction between Labor-Only Contracting and Job Contracting – has opened the floodgates of contractualization.” This is the assessment of labor center Kilusang Mayo Uno of current government policies issued to regulate contractualization. It prompted them to seek its abolition and the scrapping of labor laws that propped conractualization. </p>
<p>But this week, Duterte’s economic team issued pronouncements showing it will not scrap but just go for ‘strict and equitable’ implementation of current labor laws. Duterte’s incoming Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez clarified that “When the president-elect was talking about an end to contractualization [during the campaign], he was talking about ‘endo’ [where] five months and you’re out.” </p>
<p>There would still be seasonal and contractual workers, he said, but the President-elect would not allow it if the workers were to be kicked out just to avoid being made  permanent and therefore entitled to more labor and security benefits. </p>
<p><strong>How many contractuals will be allowed? </strong></p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Sa akin</em>, for practical reasons, <em>siguro</em> I would consider an 80-20 arrangement <em>lalo na kung malaki &#8216;yung kompanya</em>,&#8221; incoming Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello was quoted as saying in media interviews on Tuesday, at the sidelines of their consultation with the business sector. With this, “the floodgates of contractualization” that labor groups said have have been opened wide under Aquino can continue to rampage.</p>
<p>Because there are allowable or permissible contractualization, KMU pointed out in a statement April 30, the likes of what they call as contractualization king Henry Sy, Forbes-listed as richest in the Philippines, can claim SM has no contractuals. “They just have seasonal workers, all year round,” said the KMU. </p>
<p>“We welcome Duterte’s vow to stop contractualization. We have yet to see him keep his promise,” said Kabataan Partylist Rep. Sarah Elago. She added that in the weeks to come, they will remain vigilant and continue to hold protests calling for the abolition of contractualization and recognition of workers’ rights and demands. </p>
<p>“Should the administration start to fire its attacks on the people, the people has to be ready to act,” Elago ended. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a> </p>

<em>Bulatlat.com<br />
</em></p>
<p>MANILA &#8212;  After nine years in power, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has left the Malacanang palace. She is no longer cloaked with presidential immunity, which she and her allies had used to shield her from corruption charges, human-rights violations and other alleged crimes against the Filipino people.  </p>
<p>Up to her last weeks in office, impunity presented itself. For two consecutive days, journalists Jesiderio Camangyan, radio anchor of Sunrise FM in Davao Oriental, and Joselito Agustin of dzJC Aksyon Radyo in Laoag City, were shot dead. After the elections, human-rights worker Benjamin Bayles of Negros Occidental, union member Edward Panganiban of Laguna and Bayan Muna member Jim Gales of Davao were murdered in separate incidents.   </p>
<p>In the past nine years, journalists and activists have become easy targets for assassination. According to the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP), 104 journalists have been murdered under the Arroyo regime. Human-rights group Karapatan recorded 1,190 victims of extrajudicial killings under the Arroyo regime, from January 2001 to March 2010.  </p>
<p>There had been 205 victims of enforced disappearances, 1,028 victims of torture, and hundreds of thousands were forcibly displaced in rural areas as a result of military operations.    </p>
<p>These killings and other atrocities continue despite international condemnation and local protests. In fact, just this month, a five-member delegation of the Ecumenical Voice for Human Rights and Peace in the Philippines had gone to Geneva and made oral interventions at the 14th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council. They told the world that Arroyo&#8217;s counterinsurgency program has been the bloodiest and most vicious since martial law years.   </p>
<p>Arroyo, as commander in chief of the armed forces, clearly condoned the killings. The absence of culpability of the known masterminds and the rewards given to the worst violators had emboldened the perpetrators even more to commit abuses.   </p>
<p>Such impunity led to one of the greatest tragedies under the Arroyo regime, the Ampatuan massacre.  </p>
<p>Closely allied with the Arroyos, the Ampatuans thought they could get away with the murder of 57 individuals, including 31 journalists. Already, the cases filed against the warlords of Maguindanao are at risk of going down the drain.  </p>
<p>Impunity also persists in corruption and other scandals.  </p>
<p>Arroyo and her husband Jose Miguel “Mike” Arroyo have also pocketed billions in various anomalous deals in the past nine years.  </p>
<p><img src="http://www.bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/arroyo1.gif" alt="" /><br />
<img src="http://www.bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/arroyo3.gif" alt="" /></p>
<p>Using money, Arroyo was able to suppress seven impeachment cases filed against her. Using deception and repression, she was able to quell public outrage against her regime.  </p>
<p>Following the expose on the “Hello Garci” election fraud scandal, Arroyo issued Proclamation 1017 and arrested leaders of the opposition, including the late Anakpawis congressman and labor leader Crispin Beltran. She also issued what was called a calibrated preemptive response (CPR) to break up mass protests.  </p>
<p>To cover up for the cases of corruption and other scandals, Arroyo signed Executive Order 464 barring government officials from testifying before public inquiries without her approval.   </p>
<p>Just recently, the Ombudsman, a close friend of the First Gentleman and a known ally of the president, absolved Arroyo and her husband from the aborted multimillion national broadband network deal with the Chinese telecom company ZTE.  </p>
<p><strong>Doubled Wealth </strong></p>
<p>Arroyo&#8217;s declared wealth more than doubled in the past nine years. In 2001, when Arroyo took power, her total wealth was about P67 million. As of July 2009, according to her declared statement of assets and liabilities, her wealth has reached P144 million.  </p>
<p>The “Jose Pidal” account that was exposed in 2003 had P321 million and the Arroyos&#8217; real-estate properties in the United States totaled $7.1 million. The profligacy of the Arroyos, highlighted by that $20,000-dinner at Le Cirque in New York in August 2009, has enraged the poor and the hungry.  </p>
<p>For how could she stomach the expensive dinner when back home, hunger has reached record numbers, with almost one in four Filipino households going hungry? In a 2009 report by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), the Philippines ranked 34th on a scale of zero to 100 among 84 countries in the Global Hunger Index (GHI).  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The President wants media organizations to be subjective in their reports, insisting that the “good news” must be given due prominence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>BY DANILO ARAÑA ARAO</strong><br />
<em> <a href="http://www.bulatlat.com/">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo this week chided media practitioners for not giving due prominence to good news, especially at this time when there are allegedly so many “good news” that must be disseminated to the people.</p>
<p>“The good news is needed at this time to give more investors confidence in the country,” she said last November 16 at the 32nd Top Level Management Conference of the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP, Association of Broadcasters of the Philippines).</p>
<p>She wants what she considers to be the “good news” to hog the headlines in much the same way that the “bad news” usually does, arguing, &#8220;(G)ood news tended to be found anywhere but on the front pages of newspapers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The President claimed that media organizations tend to headline issues like political killings and to bury in the inside pages the arrest and detention of those allegedly responsible for them. <em>“Sana naman kapag sila ay nahuhuli at naprepreso pareho ang headline gaya ng kung noong nagpatay sila ng taga-media </em>(It is hoped that when they are arrested and jailed, it would make the headlines just as when they killed the journalists),”she said.</p>
<p>A selective scanning, however, of the media’s treatment of the killings of activists and journalists shows that there is equal prominence given to the developments surrounding the events. For example, the conviction of the killer of journalist Edgar Damalerio was prominently reported in the media. It is safe to assume that an in-depth research with a broader scope on the treatment of political killings through the years would show the efforts of media organizations to report not just the actual killings but also the efforts to solve them.</p>
<p>It is likely that Macapagal-Arroyo is unaware that journalists generally do not make any distinction between “the good and the bad” in terms of stories to write. Guided by the elements of news, they choose their stories mainly on the basis of their significance to the people’s lives. It is not the responsibility of journalists – moral or otherwise – to highlight the good news purportedly to make people feel better.</p>
<p>That the mass media tend to highlight problems simply reflects the social crisis besetting Philippine society. While it is practically impossible for mass media to report all events happening in society (thus failing to exactly mirror it), the mass media nevertheless can provide a glimpse of the national situation through a selective presentation of issues and concerns.</p>
<p>In order to be objective, this selection must be based on the various elements of news like prominence and oddity, as well as ethics of the journalism profession. There is a tendency to be subjective if the criteria of “good” and “bad” were used, for the simple reason that these concepts are subject to a person’s interpretation.</p>
<p>The same is true for the angling of stories since journalists cannot be compelled to highlight the positive and to bury (or even not report) the negative. This is like providing consolation to readers when reporting in a vain attempt to make them feel better despite the nature of a social problem.</p>
<p>Macapagal-Arroyo clearly does not want an objective mass media, but a subjective one to fulfill the administration’s agenda of not just getting investor confidence, but of making people feel better through the inundation of so-called good news, totally ignoring the important issues that they should know.  <em> <a href="http://www.bulatlat.com/" style="font-weight: bold"> (Bulatlat.com)</a></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong> Peace in the Korean Peninsula is just a fog if seen from the periscope of the U.S. Making it transparent would be asking the U.S. forces for an exit from the peninsula.</p>
<p>By Bobby Tuazon</strong><br />
 <em> <a href="http://www.bulatlat.com/">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>Peace in the Korean Peninsula is just a fog if seen from the periscope of the U.S. Making it transparent would be asking the U.S. forces for an exit from the peninsula.</p>
<p>For years, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) has been asking the United States to enter into a non-aggression treaty in exchange for Pyongyang’s dismantling of its nuclear program. But the U.S. hasn’t been buying this, threatening instead to bomb North Korea with nuclear missiles while increasing the number and firepower of its deployed forces and nuclear-armed warships in the Sea of Japan, South Korea and Okinawa in Japan.</p>
<p>Both North Korea and South Korea, which are separated by the 38th parallel, began reunification talks in the mid-1990s under Seoul’s “sunshine policy” and in fact this was highlighted by the reunion across the border of families that had been separated by war. The reunification process had been set earlier with the signing by the two countries of the Mutual Non-Aggression Treaty in 1991. The talks were welcomed by many people in both countries as a prelude to peace in the whole Korean Peninsula. Economic cooperation plans were underway.</p>
<p>The U.S. torpedoed the whole process. In 1998, the Pentagon renewed its war blueprint against Pyongyang and conducted a simulated nuclear bomb attack on North Korea. U.S. President George W. Bush, Jr. in 2001 named North Korea in his “axis of evil” along with Iraq, Iran and Cuba, accusing it of hiding “weapons of mass destruction.” This was followed by the inclusion of North Korea as a target in the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review and the following year by a blunt threat from Bush, during his State of the Union speech, that he would launch a pre-emptive attack against North Korea unless it dismantled its WMDs.</p>
<p>Somewhere in-between, Washington provoked North Korea into resuming its nuclear program by stopping shipments of heavy fuel for light water reactors that Pyongyang badly needed for its energy and food production as provided for under the 1994 U.S.-North Korea “Agreed upon Framework.” Critics said the U.S. deliberately stopped complying with its own obligations under the agreement as a means of blackmailing Pyongyang to accede to American terms and preconditions. In October 2001 and upon instructions by Bush, U.S. Assistant State Secretary James Kelly told North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Gye Wan in Pyongyang “that the U.S. now had a precondition to further engagement (negotiations on the nuclear issue) – that the DPRK’s uranium enrichment program be dismantled immediately.”</p>
<p>North Korea had had it when, in late 2005, sanctions being implemented against it by Washington forced U.S. banks to end transactions with a number of Asian and European banks that have Pyongyang accounts. Under the pretext of opposing “illicit activities,” the U.S. sanctions were aimed at restricting North Korea’s limited access to foreign exchange and economically strangling the country.</p>
<p><strong>Source of tension</strong></p>
<p>What is the real source of tension in the Korean Peninsula? Why has the U.S. scuttled the Korean reunification process and continues to reject Pyongyang’s reasonable demand for the U.S. to sign a non-aggression treaty so that North Korea, appeased by the permanent withdrawal of nuclear threat by the world’s superpower with an arsenal of 10,000 nuclear warheads, will close its nuclear program?</p>
<p>Let’s hear it from two U.S. conservative foreign policy thinkers:</p>
<p>“Reunification,” said the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington-based foreign policy think tank, “threatens vital U.S. interests in Korea…The emergence of a reunified Korea might prompt the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the ROK (Republic of Korea or South Korea) and mean the end of the special security role and influence of the United States in East Asia, a reunified Korea may mean the loss of the ROK as the sixth largest importer of U.S. arms.”</p>
<p>Former Secretary of State and foreign policy realist Henry Kissinger said the same thing in a 2001 Washington Post article: “Were tensions to ease dramatically, the presence of American troops could become highly controversial within South Korea. In turn, if these forces were removed, the future of American bases in Japan would become problematic. And if American troops left the rim of Asia, an entirely new security and, above all, political situation would arise all over the continent. Were this to happen, even a positive evolution on the Korean peninsula could lead to a quest for autonomous defense policies in Seoul and Tokyo and to a growth of nationalism in Japan, China and Korea.”</p>

POSTED BY<em> <a href="http://www.bulatlat.com/">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p> UN Security Council (UNSC) resolution No. 1718 condemning the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) and imposing sanctions on it for carrying out an underground nuclear bomb test does not stipulate any explicit permission to the US and its cohorts to launch an immediate military attack on the DPRK but lays down the basis and opens the way for further sanctions and even aggressive military action. </p>
<p>The sanctions against the DPRK  include freezing its economic and financial assets and transactions abroad, impeding  its economic, trade,  scientific, technical and other foreign relations,  travel ban on DPRK personnel and other people considered helpful in any way to the DPRK nuclear and ballistic programs,  the interdiction of DPRK means of international transport and the  inspection of all cargo going  to and from DPRK under the pretext of preventing the movement of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. </p>
<p>The declared objective of the sanctions is to punish the DPRK and pressure it to return to the six-party talks.  The sanctions are to be lifted only after the DPRK returns to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty (NPT) and gives up its nuclear and ballistic missile programs completely, verifiably and irreversibly.  As they are, the sanctions are already extremely severe but can be expanded and intensified in order to attain the objective of the US and its cohorts. </p>
<p>The resolution completely disregards the fact that the US has reneged on agreements that it has made with the DPRK in previous negotiations, that the DPRK and the Korean people have the right to assert and defend their national independence against the hostile policy of the US and that they have the sovereign right to withdraw from the NPT and develop their means of self-defense. In this regard, the UN Security Council is acting in a vicious manner against the DPRK. In contrast, Israel, India and Pakistan have not been subjected to condemnation and sanctions like the DPRK just because the US regards them as manageable allies.</p>
<p>Even as the resolution falls short of explicitly allowing aggressive military action against the DPRK, the biggest gain for the US is that it can use the condemnatory and punitive premise of the resolution as a license for further sanctions with or without any UNSC resolution and even for unilateral or multilateral military action against the DPRK in the name of the UN and international community.</p>
<p>It is amply demonstrated in the case of the US aggression against Iraq that resolutions condemning Iraq and imposing sanctions short of explicitly approving the military invasion of Iraq became ultimately  the license for the US and its “coalition of the willing” to invade and occupy Iraq in 2003.</p>
<p>Another big gain of the US lies in its success at pressing China and Russia to take a position of condemning the DPRK and thus in poisoning the relations of the three countries.  As a result, the DPRK is reasonably more than ever wary of the six-party talks or even bilateral talks with the US within the framework of the six-party talks as an anti-DPRK trap.  It is clear that the US is trying to bind Russia and China inextricably to the US aggressive policy against the DPRK and to the longstanding US nuclear monopoly in the Korean peninsula. </p>
<p>The US has publicly gloated over the votes of China and Russia for UNSC resolution 1718 in riposte specifically to China’s expression of reservation about the boarding of DPRK vessels and inspection of cargo to and from DPRK.  It would seem that China has an afterthought about the provocative and dangerous prospects of US interdicting the vessels that belong not only to DPRK but also to other countries known for or suspected of carrying prohibited goods to and from the DPRK.  Any degree of Chinese acquiescence to US hegemony and US gunboat diplomacy in the Asia-Pacific region poses threats to China itself and other countries.</p>
<p>As it is, the UNSC resolution is aimed at undermining and destabilizing the DPRK, sabotaging its economy and making life difficult for the Korean people, despite the hypocritical claims of concern for the Korean people by the signatories of the resolution.  The sanctions stipulated by the resolution are brutal enough and have far reaching adverse consequences to the DPRK. Worse, the obstructions to and slowing down of DPRK’s trade with other countries, including the disruptions of vital food and fuel supplies would inflict harsh punishment on the Korean people.</p>
<p>The US and its cohorts expect the DPRK to capitulate to their dictates as a result of the current UNSC resolution.  They want the DPRK and the Korean people to give up their national independence and their right to defend it, to degrade their self-defense capabilities and to let the US have a monopoly of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in the Korean peninsula and in the vicinity of DPRK.</p>
<p>The US and its cohorts expect the DPRK to capitulate under the pressure of a tighter US military blockade and provocations in and out of DPRK territory, severe economic and financial difficulties, disruptions in its foreign trade or else suffer social degradation and regime change or possibly cruise missile attacks and other cowardly acts or even a full scale invasion.</p>
<p>But the DPRK is quite different from recent victims of US aggression, like Yugoslavia, Iraq and Afghanistan.  It has nuclear weapons. These are so few in comparison to the huge nuclear power of the US.  But they have a high deterrent value and can be useful for pressing the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and advancing towards the cause of seeking the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons in the entire world. </p>
<p>The DPRK is vulnerable to US military attacks of any kind. But so are the US military forces to DPRK counterattack, especially in South Korea and Japan. It is the US and its cohorts that are irresponsible and are playing with brinkmanship by trying to coerce the DPRK to return to the six-party talks to be encircled, bullied and humiliated.  The US must heed the calls for restraint and meet the just and reasonable demands of the Korean people and the DPRK. </p>
<p>It is understandable that the Korean people and the DPRK resolutely and vigorously assert their national sovereignty and independence, stand up to US imperialism and its cohorts, resist the longrunning and current unjust impositions of imperialist powers, totally reject UNSC resolution 1718 and express determination and readiness for both dialogue and confrontation. All people who fight for national independence, democracy, justice and peace are in solidarity with the Korean people and the DRPK as they strive under the principle of self-reliance to cope with and prevail over any adversity.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Biggest WMD stockpile is in the U.S., AGHAM says</p>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. is the only country to have used the atomic bomb which killed 220,000 people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It has the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. With no less than 10,600 nuclear warheads intact, it is the presence of U.S. nuclear weapons that is clearly putting the world in danger.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>  POSTED BY<em><a href="http://www.bulatlat.com/">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo misses the point of why we should be worried about the North Korean situation. This was the reaction of AGHAM chairperson Dr. Giovanni Tapang to Arroyo&#8217;s warning that the Philippines was &#8220;within striking distance&#8221; of North Korean weapons. AGHAM (Samahan ng Nagtataguyod ng Agham at Teknolohiya para sa Sambayanan) is a progressive organization of scientists and engineers.</p>
<p>&#8220;GMA should realize it is U.S. aggression that destabilizes regional security and that the presence of U.S. troops in our soil makes us targets for retaliatory action,&#8221; noted Dr. Tapang, who is also a physicist at the University of the Philippines, Diliman, Quezon City.</p>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. is the only country to have used the atomic bomb which killed 220,000 people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is the U.S. that has the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. With no less than 10,600 nuclear warheads intact, 8,000 of which are considered active or operational and 3,000 ready to deploy from its &#8216;Enduring Stockpile&#8217;, it is the presence of U.S. nuclear weapons that is clearly putting the world in danger&#8221;, Dr. Tapang pointed out.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the U.S. that has been trying to enforce its war of terror by constantly threatening a nuclear war. It is this nuclear blackmail that is being used against so-called ‘rogue’ states while it is keeping a blind eye on its allied states: Israel, India and Pakistan, all of whom have nuclear weapons,&#8221; added Dr. Tapang.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so easy for the GMA government to ride on the wave of condemnation to North Korea&#8217;s action, while keeping a double-standard and closing her eyes to the fact that the U.S. has one of the biggest stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction capable of being launched from and targeted to anywhere in the planet,&#8221; said Dr. Tapang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our country has kowtowed to U.S. military interests. Take the case of the VFA 9Visiting Forces Agreement) rape case and countless other examples, U.S. troops have ridden roughshod on our sovereignty and yet the government continues to allow the U.S. government and troops access to large areas of our national territory in the guise of &#8220;Balikatan&#8221; exercises,&#8221; lamented Dr. Tapang.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is no surprise then that the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) has been trying all possible ways to defend itself from aggression given that for several years the U.S. has been sounding its war drums against the  DPRK,&#8221; said Dr. Tapang.</p>
<p>&#8220;To promote genuine regional security, the government should be calling instead for U.S. troops’ pullout from the region and to establish truly equal relations among nations in the region. It is the complete prohibition and destruction of all nuclear weapons, including those of the U.S., Russia, China and others, not just for selected states, that should be pursued,&#8221; concluded Dr. Tapang. <strong>Posted by Bulatlat</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The impending implementation of the National ID System after a Supreme Court ruling upholding its constitutionality will be a major setback for civil liberties according Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) secretary general Renato M. Reyes, Jr, one of the petitioners in the Supreme Court case.  </p>
<p>&#8220;In a time when civil liberties are already bludgeoned by so many repressive measures, pushing through with the ID system is a dangerous proposition. The administration is not exactly a model of respect for human rights. It is not an exaggeration to say that the ID system can be abused under this government,&#8221; Bayan&#8217;s Reyes said.</p>
<p>Bayan disputed claims by Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita that the ID system will only cover government employees.   </p>
<p>&#8220;The ID system is a form of population control. Vital information is compiled for the purpose of closely monitoring and, when deemed necessary, placing restrictions on the movements, activities and transactions of individuals covered by the system. It will cover government employees today but there is nothing to prevent government from using the ID system on everyone,&#8221; Reyes said.</p>
<p>Reyes said that the ID system can in the future become a requisite for all transactions with government offices. &#8220;And since many people need to transact with government, they have no choice but to acquire the multi-purpose ID. They can be compelled in the future. The administration is just testing the waters now with this limited implementation,&#8221; Reyes warned.</p>
<p>Bayan agreed with the dissenting opinion of Justice Consuel Santiago that there are no assurances that abuses of the ID system will not happen. Bulatlat</p>

Militants hit Gonzales for reducing charges vs. 3 U.S. Marines</strong></p>
<p>The militant Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) hit Justice Secretary Raul Gonzales for reducing the charges against three of the four U.S. Marines accused of raping a 22-year-old Filipina in November last year.</p>
<p>In an interview with reporters in his office at the Department of Justice (DOJ), Gonzalez said he would have dismissed the cases against US Marine Lance Corporals Keith Silkwood and Dominic Duplantis and Staff Sergeant Chad Carpentier if not for mob rule.</p>
<p>The DOJ stated the three U.S. Marines would only be charged as accessories to the rape case. Only Lance Cpl. Daniel Smith will remain as the principal suspect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gonzales&#8217; statement is tantamount to absolving Smith too,” Bayan chairperson Carol Araullo said. “Smith, the principal suspect, claims that he had consensual sex with the victim. If the three were not part of the conspiracy to commit rape, as DOJ believes, then they could say that they were just watching Smith and the victim having consensual sex. Gonzales is in effect weakening the case against the four U.S. Marines.&#8221;</p>
<p>In an interview over DZMM, Evelyn Ursua, lawyer of the victim, said there was a clear evidence of gang rape. </p>
<p>&#8220;The Subic rape case is not a mere rape case as Gonzales and even Ignacio Bunye would like the public to believe,” Araullo said. This case is a testimony to the loopholes of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA). This case is a testimony to the continuing subservience of the Philippine government to the U.S. government.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Secretary Gonzales is doing injustice not only to the 22-year old rape victim but to the Filipino people who have long been held captive by the U.S. government&#8217;s arrogance and oppression,&#8221; Araullo added.</p>
<p>Reacting to Ursua&#8217;s plan of elevating the case to the Office of the President, Araullo said, &#8220;It would be very interesting to know what Arroyo would say about the case. Her statement on this could be another political explosive.&#8221;  <em> <a href="http://www.bulatlat.com/" style="font-weight: bold"> (Bulatlat.com)</a></em></p>

<p><strong>Based on the latest survey of an independent research think-tank, it appears that four out of every five Filipinos are dissatisfied with Gloria Macapagal Arroyo&#8217;s performance as President while three out of every five Filipinos think that the economy has gotten worse.</strong></p>
<p>Majority of Filipinos think that the economy has gotten worse and an even bigger number are dissatisfied with Gloria Macapagal Arroyo&#8217;s performance as President.</p>
<p>According to the latest survey by IBON Foundation, an independent research think-tank, the number of respondents who replied that the economy worsened fell to 64.6% in January 2006 from 68.5% in October 2005. Similarly, respondents who replied that the economy was better increased from 1.5% in October 2005 to 2.3% in January 2006.</p>
<p>Despite this, President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo still recorded a net satisfaction rating of  -75%, with 7.9% of respondents saying that her performance was “satisfactory” against 82.8% who said that it was “unsatisfactory.”</p>
<p>This means that four out of every five Filipinos are dissatisfied with Gloria Macapagal Arroyo&#8217;s performance as President while three out of every five Filipinos think that the economy has gotten worse.</p>
<p>The latest IBON nationwide survey was conducted from January 1-11, 2006 with 1,331 respondents from various sectors. The survey used a multi-stage probability sampling scheme with a margin of error of plus or minus three percent.</p>
<p>Below is the tabulation of results of the people’s perception on the economy and government’s performance.  <em> <a href="http://www.bulatlat.com/">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
