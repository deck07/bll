<p>MANILA &#8212; Different from past November 30 commemoration of Bonifacio Day in Metro Manila, the protesters who marched from Liwasang Bonifacio after holding a program there were prevented by policemen a block away from Mendiola (Chino Roces) Bridge. The police hit the rallyists with their shields, truncheons, and blasts of water from their firefighters. But the latter stood their ground and remained on Claro M. Recto Avenue where they eventually held the second part of their Bonifacio Day commemoration.</p>

<p>Marching to Mendiola typically follows a November 30 program at Liwasang Bonifacio where various progressive groups mark the birthday of Andres Bonifacio by taking inspiration from the national armed uprising he led in the final decade of 19th century. In going near Malacañang, they aim to condemn its occupants&#8217; latest policies and actions which they say directly contradicted the principles and aspirations of Andres Bonifacio.</p>
<p>&#8220;Andres Bonifacio fought for sovereignty, the opposite of what Duterte is doing. Andres Bonifacio is a revolutionary, President Duterte is not,&#8221; said Elmer &#8220;Bong&#8221; Labog, national president of Kilusang Mayo Uno (KMU), in the opening program at Liwasang Bonifacio. He and other mass leaders described Duterte&#8217;s revolutionary government as &#8216;bogus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bonifacio fought for a society that&#8217;s truly serving the people; President Duterte is seeking to serve only himself and a handful of exploiters and oppressors, Labog said.</p>
<figure id="attachment_101119" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-101119" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Nov3012017_Lumad_LB2.jpg" alt="Save our Schools" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Nov3012017_Lumad_LB2.jpg 800w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Nov3012017_Lumad_LB2-500x280.jpg 500w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Nov3012017_Lumad_LB2-649x365.jpg 649w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Nov3012017_Lumad_LB2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Nov3012017_Lumad_LB2-728x410.jpg 728w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Nov3012017_Lumad_LB2-344x193.jpg 344w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Nov3012017_Lumad_LB2-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Nov3012017_Lumad_LB2-180x100.jpg 180w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">&#8220;Where there are big foreign companies trying to get their hands on our resources, the military is present as &#8216;investment defense forces.'&#8221;</figcaption></figure>
<p>Labog cited contractualization which President Duterte promised to put an end to when he was wooing the people&#8217;s votes. &#8220;Contractualization was institutionalized rather than ended, he said. He added that Duterte also has not acted on the housing problem &#8212; it was Kadamay who took action. And there also remains no new law on land reform. Other trade unionists denounced the new burdens being imposed by the Duterte government on the people. Lito Fadriquelan of Ilaw-Buklod ng Manggagawa (IBM-KMU) criticized the Duterte government&#8217;s efforts to impose additional taxes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even the simple problem of traffic this government has not yet solved,&#8221; Labog said during the program at Liwasang Bonifacio.</p>
<p>Far from being a revolutionary, Duterte is all for <em>&#8220;patay, patay, patay</em>,&#8221; (kill, kill, kill) said Bayan secretary-general Renato Reyes Jr. He said Duterte has five more agreed locations with the US for military bases in the Philippines. &#8220;Duterte is launching an all-out war.&#8221;<br />

Rather than gaining peace and prosperity, the people under Duterte are suffering and set to suffer further due to his adoption of tested as flawed policies of neoliberalization. &#8220;Despite his all-out war, despite his threats of a crackdown, Duterte himself is pushing the people to fight back,&#8221; said Jerome Succor Aba, president of Suara Bangsamoro.</p>
<p>Often unreported, many communities continue to be bombed as we speak to give way to large-scale mining activities, said Joms Salvador. With this ongoing injustice, &#8220;Can we blame our compatriot if they take up arms?&#8221;.</p>

Many protesters’ faces were set in a grim likeness, smiling-but-not-smiling, a kind of general resignation that this day, like so many others before it, might simply be another day of disappointment for all.</p>
<p><strong>By IAN IRVING BAZARTE</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA – <em>“Ang init,”</em> Kuya Mark remarked as he soldiered on through the heat with his placard held high and his head set straight.</p>
<p>It was around 12:45 noontime, and the many groups, communities, and individuals that had gathered thanks to the initiative of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) were marching along three northbound lanes of Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City, on their way to Batasan Road to air out their grievances as close to the Batasang Pambansa complex as they could get, where President Rodrigo Duterte was set to make his second State of the Nation Address (SONA)</p>
<p>Some 40,000 marchers and their accoutrements – transports and supply jeepneys, vans, and the like – filled a huge chunk of Commonwealth Avenue and the whole length of Batasan Road from Sandiganbayan up to the stage set up in front of the Batasan Hills National High School.<br />
The prevailing mood seemed to be cheerfulness, as many marchers could be seen smiling and joking with their buddies and fellow marchers.</p>
<p>The stifling noon heat – and later, intermittent rains – did not seem to deter the marchers and their programs any, as they used placards and tarpaulins, clothes and notebooks and anything that could be used as makeshift shade and umbrellas to shield them from the elements, all the while snickering as they did so.</p>
<p><em>“O di ba, multi-purpose ‘to,”</em> boasted one of them, and his companions laughed.</p>
<p>But there seemed to be another feeling floating around, too, in the way that many protesters’ faces were set in a grim likeness, smiling-but-not-smiling, a kind of general resignation that this day, like so many others before it, might simply be another day of disappointment for all.<br />
<figure id="attachment_98502" style="width: 4000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/dsc_2723i/"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_2723i.jpg" alt="(Photo by Ian Irving Bazarte/Bulatlat)" width="4000" height="2667" class="size-full wp-image-98502" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_2723i.jpg 4000w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_2723i-547x365.jpg 547w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_2723i-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_2723i-840x560.jpg 840w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_2723i-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 4000px) 100vw, 4000px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(Photo by Ian Irving Bazarte/Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Kuya Mark, who was one of the members of the urban poor group Kadamay, captured the sentiment well: <em>&#8220;Sana kasi may mangyari dito, kasi nakakasawa na.”</em> (I hope something meaningful happens today, because all this is getting frustrating.)</p>
<p><strong>‘We were let down by the government’</strong></p>
<p>Many protesters, despite their general cheery mien, admitted to feeling more than disappointment at the Duterte administration.<br />
Jocy Lopez, chairperson of Kadamay-North Triangle, said she was “angry” and felt “let down” by the Duterte government. She lamented that Duterte seemed to be only paying attention to the ongoing conflict in Marawi City, but not on the plight of urban poor communities.</p>
<p><em>“Simple lang naman hiling namin&#8230; Ang gusto namin, dahil mahirap lang kami, bigyan niyo kami ng tiyak na kabuhayan at ligtas na tirahan at yung may trabahong may sahod na nakakabuhay sa aming pamilya,”</em> she said. (All we want is simple. We’re poor, give us secure jobs and safe homes and wages that could support our families.)<br />
<em>“Dapat isipin din niya, ‘wag kalimutan, na may pangako siya sa taong bayan,”</em> she added. (He mustn’t forget he has a duty to the people.)</p>
<p>Danny dela Fuente, 68, National Coordinator of Samahan ng mga Ex-Detainees Laban sa Aresto at Detensyon (Selda), said he felt somewhat disappointed because all that Duterte seemed to have done in his first year was to hasten the implementation of the Human Rights Victims Reparation and Recognition Act of 2013, of which he was a beneficiary, being a detainee during the Martial Law era of dictator Ferdinand Marcos for four years.</p>
<p>He bemoaned that only 4,000 of the applicants eligible to receiving reparations were given the money they deserved, and only P12,000 ($240) out of the promised P25,000 ($495)were given to them.</p>
<p>He also decried the continuing imprisonment of at least 392 political prisoners, some of whom are consultants of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) and should thus be protected by the Comprehensive Agreement on the Respect for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law (CARHRIHL).</p>
<p><em>“Kaugnay ng karapatang pantao, bagsak pa rin siya, bagsak,”</em> dela Fuente said. (Regarding human rights, he fails, big time.)<br />
These feelings manifested in the groups’ burnings of effigies depicting their opposition to Duterte’s bloody war on drugs and what they saw as his increasingly fascistic side.<br />

A group burned down a huge effigy depicting Duterte wearing military clothes and a cap with the word “Pasista” emblazoned on it while holding on to a missile they dubbed Martial Law.</p>
<p>One protester dressed up as the Grim Reaper, wearing a Duterte mask to show how the President seemed to be to so many Filipinos, with the thousands that had been killed under the Duterte administration war on drugs, which often seemed to target only the poor.</p>
<p>Later, the giant Duterte plywood effigy depicting his “leftist” and “fascist” sides were torn down by angry protesters.</p>
<p><strong>Jeepney drivers march in People’s SONA</strong></p>
<p>What little violence happened throughout the whole afternoon came from brief scuffles between protesters from the transport sector, who were threatened with the phaseout of jeepneys, a project started by former President Noynoy Aquino and now being continued by Duterte’s officials in the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulation Board (LTFRB).<br />
<figure id="attachment_98464" style="width: 2048px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/sona-2017-save-our-jeepnys-by-loi/"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sona-2017-save-our-jeepnys-by-loi.jpg" alt="(Photo by Carlo Manalansan/Bulatlat)" width="2048" height="1356" class="size-full wp-image-98464" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sona-2017-save-our-jeepnys-by-loi.jpg 2048w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sona-2017-save-our-jeepnys-by-loi-551x365.jpg 551w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sona-2017-save-our-jeepnys-by-loi-768x509.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sona-2017-save-our-jeepnys-by-loi-840x556.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(Photo by Carlo Manalansan/Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure><br />
Some of these protesters – jeepney drivers themselves – hounded jeepney drivers passing by Commonwealth Avenue, throwing rocks and sandals at them, exhorting them to “fight with us, for all of us.” Some even accused the drivers of being too complicit with the whims and fancies of the government, and thus to blame for all jeepney drivers’ situation.</p>
<p><em>“Mga buwaya kayo,”</em> screamed one protester, throwing one of his slippers at an oncoming jeepney.</p>
<p><em>“Nakaka-traffic lang kayo,”</em> came the shouted reply of the jeepney driver as he slowed down his jeepney, honked his horn and with one hand gave the middle finger to the protester.</p>
<p><em>“Dapat rehabilitasyon lang, hindi yung phaseout ng jeep&#8230; ‘Di naman kami tutol sa modification, sa modified eh, kaya lang sana, tinawag nila ng public hearing sabay pinaalam sa tao,”</em> said Henry Villaluz, 53, a jeepney driver plying the Marikina-Pasig route every day.</p>
<p>Villaluz said Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) like Uber and Grab are hurting small operators like them, and along with privately-owned vehicles make traffic more intense.<br />
<em>“Sana yung gawang Pinoy ang tangkilikin, hindi yung mga basura ng ibang bansa dito dadalin,”</em> Vilaluz said angrily.</p>
<p>This was a sentiment shared by Jeffrey Cioco, 36, another jeepney driver plying the route from Binangonan, Rizal to Jose Rizal University (JRU) and nearby Ortigas Center.</p>
<p><em>“Kung matuloy ang phaseout na ‘to, maraming mawawalan ng trabaho na driver. Di rin naman kami marunong mag-construction, ito lang alam naming trabaho,”</em> Cioco lamented.</p>
<p>Tensions flew in the air too between the marchers and a smaller gaggle of pro-Duterte groups who were holding their own “pro-Duterte rally” near Sandiganbayan building, just outside the entrance to Batasan Hills, with shouts of “Umuwi na kayo!” echoing from both sides. None of them came to blows over it.</p>
<p><strong>The road is a marketplace</strong></p>
<p>Residents along Batasan Road rushed out of their houses to bear witness to the protesters’ march. Many were children, and they watched spellbound as the large effigies of Duterte passed by.<br />
<a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/dsc_2960/"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_2960.jpg" alt="DSC_2960" width="4336" height="3728" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-98504" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_2960.jpg 4336w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_2960-425x365.jpg 425w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_2960-768x660.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_2960-840x722.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 4336px) 100vw, 4336px" /></a><br />
<em>“Hala may naglalakad na Duterte o’,”</em> one of the children, dressed in a brown shirt and red shorts, excitedly shouted upon seeing<br />
a large effigy of Duterte cross the street.</p>
<p>Street vendors started popping up around Batasan, too, peddling everything from buko juice to popcorn to keychains and even clothes and hats. By the end of the day, many had probably made a killing in profits, such as ice cream vendors.</p>
<p><strong>A People’s SONA twist</strong></p>
<p>Many protesters – even during the march and after they had settled down to listen to the programs – appeared worried, and kept glancing over and over at the rows of policemen stationed along the sidewalks, standing tall and proud and, for many protesters, somewhat threatening in their crisp uniforms.</p>
<p>How could they not be wary? In the years before Duterte, these police personnel were the bane of their rallies, with their wooden batons and truncheons and riot shields and tear gas and fire trucks ready to hose protesters with jets of water.</p>
<p><em>“Ayan na naman sila o,”</em> a protester remarked.<br />
<figure id="attachment_98503" style="width: 4000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/dsc_2559i/"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_2559i.jpg" alt="(Photo by Ian Irving Bazarte/Bulatlat)" width="4000" height="2667" class="size-full wp-image-98503" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_2559i.jpg 4000w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_2559i-547x365.jpg 547w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_2559i-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_2559i-840x560.jpg 840w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/DSC_2559i-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 4000px) 100vw, 4000px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(Photo by Ian Irving Bazarte/Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure><br />
But there was to be no violence between the two parties this year. The police, like in last year’s SONA, met the protesters not with weapons, but with civil, polite words and even some smiles here and there.</p>
<p>No ice candy-wielding policemen appeared either, though, a rough indication that police and protesters viewed each other with wary eyes.<br />
When the protesters entered Batasan Road, the tune changed. Parts of the road thickened with police, and eventually military personnel dressed in fatigues and helmets and brandishing long-armed weapons started appearing in view.</p>
<p>Many protesters looked at these soldiers – posted in every floor of the school buildings on each side – with apprehension and some fear.</p>
<p>This, despite earlier announcements from no less than the Philippine National Police (PNP)’s chief Director Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa that there would be no weapons from government security forces in the SONA protests.</p>
<p><em>“Nakabaril sila ‘o,”</em> exclaimed a woman clad in red, pointing at the military personnel with slightly shaking fingers.</p>
<p><em>“Iba talaga ngayon, aba,”</em> said another, with a subtle shake of her head.<br />
Some protesters became almost confrontational, too.</p>
<p></em>“‘Kala ko ba walang baril? Mga siraulo ‘to ah,”</em> a youth walking nearby remarked, cracking his fingers. His two friends walking beside him nodded to show their agreement.<br />

Someone nearby shouted an expletive at a police officer standing by, who did not so much as flinch or look at the direction from where the shout came from.</p>
<p>It turned out that the beefed-up security was for the highest official of the land, who came out to talk to the rallyists after finishing his SONA in Congress. It was almost 7 p.m., and by that time, the heat, the rains, the long march and the whole year of frustration with unfulfilled promises had built up into the marchers a deep, surly mood that exploded when President Duterte appeared on stage:</p>
<p><em>“Boo!”<br />
“Never again! Never again! Never again to martial law!<br />
“Peace talks, ituloy! Peace talks, ituloy!”</em></p>
<p>Did the President even hear them? The press conference he held right after showed he, too, was in a surly mood. The rains poured on.  <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>&#8220;We now face the US-Duterte regime, imperialist tool in oppressing the Filipino people.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>By DEE AYROSO</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA – On his second State of the Nation Address (SONA), President Duterte made another record first, as right after giving his two-hour official speech inside Congress, he walked straight outside to Batasan Road, to face thousands of protesters who had just spent the whole day criticizing his administration.</p>
<p>His appeal to activists has apparently waned, as Duterte faced a disaffected crowd, many of whom jeered and shouted as he walked into the stage surrounded by Presidential Security Guards (PSG).  </p>
<p>The rallyists led by Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan) got their chance to voice out to the President himself the slogans they have long chanted in past protests, such as, lift martial law in Mindanao, resume peace talks, free all political prisoners, make contractual workers regular, withdraw military troops from communities.</p>
<p><em>“Ano? Ano sinasabi?”</em> Duterte would repeatedly say, in reaction to the occasional chanting.</p>
<p><em>“Meron kayong isyu, naintindihan ko. Alam ninyo ang posisyon ko. Alam ninyo na ginagawa ko ang lahat. Hindi ko sinasabi na tinatalikuran ko yan. </em> (I know you have issues, you know I’m doing everything. I am not saying that I have turned my back on you),” said Duterte. </p>
<p>The President’s words failed to bring cheer to the protesters, nor did their slogans to him, as he berated them in a press conference he held afterwards. But his move did boost the groups’ confidence, as they said Duterte showed recognition of the growing strength of the progressive movement, whose ranks continue to increase and achieve gains in mass campaigns in the past year under his administration.</p>
<p>“For the first time, the President of the Philippines, the most powerful person in the country, went here because he acknowledged that our demands are legitimate,” said Teddy Casiño, Bayan spokesperson, after Duterte has left.<br />
<figure id="attachment_98459" style="width: 1626px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2017/07/24/peoples-sona-2017-thousands-of-protesters-show-discontent-as-they-face-duterte/sona-2017-by-loi/" rel="attachment wp-att-98459"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sona-2017-by-loi-e1500921509298.jpg" alt="(Photo by Carlo Manalansan/Bulatlat)" width="1626" height="974" class="size-full wp-image-98459" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sona-2017-by-loi-e1500921509298.jpg 1626w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sona-2017-by-loi-e1500921509298-609x365.jpg 609w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sona-2017-by-loi-e1500921509298-768x460.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sona-2017-by-loi-e1500921509298-840x503.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1626px) 100vw, 1626px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(Photo by Carlo Manalansan/Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure><br />
Though they have dwindled to only a few thousands when Duterte came out before 7 PM, the protesters&#8217; ranks were in tens of thousands earlier in the day, as they converged along Commonwealth Avenue coming from various protest points in Metro Manila. </p>
<p>Simultaneous SONA protests were also held in key cities nationwide, including in Marawi City where evacuees marched to call for an end to martial law in Mindanao.</p>
<p><strong>’Don’t ambush me’</strong></p>
<p>Interrupted by the occasional chanting, the President said, “You can shout at me,” but asked the crowd to “keep the line open,” and not treat him as an enemy.</p>
<p><em>“E pati pa ako inaambush pa ninyo&#8230; walang ganunan. Pag ginanun ninyo ako, tatalikod na talaga ako&#8230; ba-bye na lang. Wala nang peace talks</em> (But you ambushed me. If you do that, I will really turn my back on you),” he said. </p>
<p>Duterte was referring to the wounding of <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2017/07/19/psg-opens-fire-suspected-rebels-north-cotabato/" target="_blank">four PSG men who shot it out with New People Army (NPA)</a> members who set up a checkpoint in Arakan, North Cotabato on July 19, in opposition to the martial law in the island. Following the incident, Duterte had called off the peace talks with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP). Solicitor general Jose Calida had then ordered the re-arrest of the NDFP peace consultants freed on bail.<br />

Casiño, speaking after Duterte left, said that the NDFP had denied making him a target, and that he was, in fact, not even in the remote distance of the place of incident.</p>
<p>Duterte may have heard their calls, but his response merely warded off, instead of addressing the issues.</p>
<p>Responding to the call to end the martial law in Mindanao, Duterte said he needs time to finish the conflict with the Dawlah Islamiyah in Marawi, which reportedly holds some 300 hostages.  </p>
<p>On the call to push through with his promise to free all political prisoners, he said that the military will not allow such. Human rights group Karapatan documented 58 activists arrested under Duterte, while 34 were released on bail, presidential pardon or through legal efforts of their lawyers and families. </p>
<p>The latest political detainees were <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2017/07/22/8-youth-protesters-arrested-congress-deliberation-mindanao-martial-law/" target="_blank">the eight youths who were arrested for protesting inside the Batasan</a> plenary hall during the joint special session of Congress to voted for the extension of Mindanao martial law. They remain in detention in spite of their lawyers&#8217; attempt to post bail because the police office in Camp Caringal was closed on July 24.</p>
<p>On contractualization, he assured that Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III is “the most Leftist” official and he will do something about it. Duterte also told the progressives to ask their “representatives” in government about reforms, referring to his appointees, former mass leaders Agrarian Reform Secretary Rafael “Ka Paeng” Mariano, Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo and National Anti-Poverty Commission chairperson Liza Maza. </p>
<p>The three Cabinet officials were also in the rally earlier. &#8220;You can depend on us to continue to push for and discuss (with the Cabinet) the legitimate and just calls of the Filipino people,&#8221; said Mariano.</p>
<p><strong>The SONA protesters: the contractual workers, the jobless, the evacuees, the families of victims of war on drugs</strong></p>
<p>Among the protesters are contractual workers, government employees and professionals, landless farm workers from Central and Southern Luzon, unemployed urban poor whose homes are threatened with demolition. There were also relatives of political prisoners arrested in the past year under Duterte, as well as detainees recently freed on the strength of their case. Also present were relatives of drug suspects killed in the War on Drugs.<br />

The President’s bold gesture to face the SONA protesters failed to lessen their discontent, as they have heard part of his speech inside Congress, which mentioned nothing about the change that the progressives want to see: justice for human rights victims, genuine land reform, national industrialization, independent foreign policy.</p>
<p>Worse, in his SONA, Duterte said the Lumad from Mindanao “should go home.” Among the protesters were some 200 Lumad peasants, students and teachers who recently evacuated due to military operations from their communities in Surigao del Sur and Davao del Norte. In his press conference after talking to the protesters, Duterte reiterated his statement, as he denigrated the alternative Lumad schools as “teaching subversion, communism” and threatened to drop bombs on them. </p>
<p>One such school, the Alternative Learning Center for Agricultural Development, or Alcadev, is a government-certified school for the Lumad which has sent its graduates to college, or to serve as volunteer para-teachers, agriculturists or health workers in the communities. It has been persistently under attack by the military which calls it &#8220;an NPA school,&#8221; a line now echoed by Duterte.</p>
<p><strong>‘We now face the US-Duterte Regime’</strong></p>
<p>During the program earlier, Bayan secretary general Renato Reyes Jr. said last year’s optimism about the Duterte regime is gone. He cited how the President’s economic managers merely continued policies that favor business investors at the expense of the economy which remains stunted, and the people who are mired in worsening poverty. He cited how economic officials are against additional pension for SSS, free tuition for state universities and colleges, and ending contractualization. On the other hand, such officials favor increased excise tax on basic goods.</p>
<p>“The real state of the nation is the deepening crisis of the semi-colonial, semi-feudal system. The real state of the nation is the devastated city of Marawi. The real state of the nation is the half-a-million evacuees in Iligan and other parts of Mindanao,” he said.</p>
<p>Reyes also cited the increasing militarism of the Duterte administration, citing the extension of martial law in Mindanao until Dec. 31 this year, which was approved by the joint special session of Congress on July 22. He also warned of a possibility of its being imposed nationwide.<br />

He said Duterte’s measures fits well with the design of the US government for the Philippines, as he has allowed the continuation of the joint PH-US military exercises, the increased role of US troops in the Marawi conflict, and the spoiling of the peace talks by militarist officials.</p>
<p><em>“Mga kasama, mga kapatid, tunay ngang kaharap natin ngayon ang rehimeng US-Duterte, kasangkapan ng imperyalismo sa pang-aapi sa mamamayang Pilipino</em> (Comrades, we now face the US-Duterte regime, imperialist tool in oppressing the Filipino people),&#8221;  said Reyes.</p>
<p>This was depicted in the main SONA effigies, which showed Duterte with an iron fist, followed closely by an Army tank with Uncle Sam, Finance Secretary Sonny Dominguez and Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana on board. Uncle Sam, symbolizing the US, has a bloodied hand and appears to be patting the Duterte effigy and the bloody Presidential Seal.</p>
<p>The effigies were supposed to be burned on Batasan Road, but this was thwarted with Duterte&#8217;s gesture. Instead, the flat, plywood effigy of Bayan-Southern Tagalog showing a two-sided Duterte &#8212; with the &#8220;Leftist&#8221; image on one side with his raised fist, and his Hitler likeness on the other &#8212; was beaten up and dismantled to pieces.</p>
<p><em>“Kanino tayo mananalig? Kanino tayo aasa? Walang ibang maaasahan ngayon kundi ang sama-samang pagkilos at paglaban. Sama-sama nating haharapin ang anumang pasistang teror na ihahasik ni Duterte</em> (On whom will we trust? On whom will we rely? There is nothing to depend on now but our collective action and resistance. Let us face together whatever fascist terror Duterte will sow),” Reyes said.<br />

<strong>By RED CARAO</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat</a></em></p>
<p>The alliance of progressive groups, Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan), is bringing an effigy back to the State of the Nation Address (SONA), after skipping the tradition last year.</p>
<p>After assessing the first year of President Rodrigo Duterte, Bayan and its member organizations have decided to make an effigy again to depict their contentions about the policies that were implemented during the past months, and the promises Duterte failed to keep. Through art, the group also showcases the people’s opposition to such policies.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Bayan’s effigy is a caricature of the highest official of the land, the President, as defined by a dominant policy or character of the administration. Another tradition is the burning of the effigy, to show the people’s rage against the ruling system and its representative. </p>
<p>In this year’s effigy, Duterte is not the main feature.</p>
<p>“[The theme of the effigy] is the continuing economic and political repression in the country,” said Max Santiago of Ugat Lahi, a cultural group tasked with the construction of the effigy. </p>
<p>Santiago cited the continuing neoliberal policies and militarization, and the resulting economic and political repression under the Duterte administration. He added that their effigy will feature US intervention in the country.</p>
<p>Drawing inspiration from the movie, <em>Mad Max,</em> the effigy to be burned tomorrow bears the semblance of Uncle Sam and US President Donald Trump. The character representing the US has a face mask connected to a globe, portrayed to look as though it is living off the resources of the earth; which the group sees as the root of Philippine poverty.</p>
<p>Defense secretary Delfin Lorenzana and Finance secretary Carlos Dominguez III also made it in this year’s effigy, alongside Duterte. Lorenzana represents the political repression, and Dominguez represents the economic issues that the group wanted to emphasize about the Duterte administration.<br />
<figure id="attachment_98416" style="width: 3264px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2017/07/24/sona-2017-progressive-groups-bring-back-effigy-not-just-dutertes/c-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-98416"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/C.jpg" alt="(Photo by Red Cara/Bulatlat)" width="3264" height="2448" class="size-full wp-image-98416" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/C.jpg 3264w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/C-487x365.jpg 487w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/C-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/C-840x630.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 3264px) 100vw, 3264px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(Photo by Red Cara/Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure><br />
Bayan’s Gel Marcelino said that the decision to make an effigy came from a careful analysis of Duterte’s term, and his policies that are affecting the Filipino people. Their group previously lauded Duterte’s pronouncements to fight for an independent foreign policy and to end policies, such as contractualization and the presence of US troops in the country, hence the absence of an effigy last year. </p>
<p>Instead, rallyists in last year’s SONA carried depiction of the People’s Agenda, the changes they want to see and had proposed to Duterte, such as genuine agrarian reform, national industrialization and a self-sustaining economy.</p>
<p>However, the group observed that the same policies still exist after the change of officials.</p>
<p>Marcelino said that this is where the role of the mass movement comes in.</p>
<p>“The mass movement wants Duterte to listen to them,” Marcelino said. “However, at the end of the day, we believe it is in the hands of the masses to fight for the change they want, it is a combination of mobilizations in the streets and lobbying in Congress.”</p>
<p>The burning of the effigy symbolizes the people’s rejection of these policies which, according to Bayan, has done nothing to improve the lives of the Filipino people. </p>
<p>However, Teddy Casino from Bayan said that the act of burning the effigy bearing Duterte’s likeness has not been decided yet by the group. In their ranks, there are some opposing views whether it should be burned or not.</p>
<p>“[Burning the effigy] is an act of condemnation. It has a symbolic sense, almost like burning bridges. We do not know how [Duterte] will react if we burned it, but nevertheless it will send a strong message,” Casino said.</p>
<p>Unlike last year where there were no anti-president sentiments during the rally, various progressive groups are expected to march towards Batasan Complex for a rally showcasing their grievances against Duterte. Among the protesters are more than a hundred Lumad evacuees from Mindanao, whose call is for Martial Law to be lifted and for the militarization of their land to stop.<br />

<p>“Our hope for change under Duterte is rapidly eroding.”</p>
<p><strong>By DEE AYROSO</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA – After only a year in power, President Duterte is fast losing the support of national minorities who are disappointed that their communities continue to be under attack under his administration, especially after his declaration of martial law in Mindanao.</p>
<p>Amid certainty of extension, and even expansion of the Mindanao martial law, the national alliance of indigenous peoples and Moro, Sandugo, appealed to Duterte for its end, and to the government’s “all-out war against the Filipino people, specially the national minorities.”</p>
<p>The group said that amid “the worsening sufferings of the national minorities,” they have no choice but to withdraw their support from the President if he pushes to lengthen and broaden martial law.</p>
<p>“Our hope for change under Duterte is rapidly eroding,” said Jerome Succor Aba, Sandugo co-convenor. “If President Duterte continues to listen to his generals, whom he called pro-American, extends martial law and intensifies total war, he will only lose the support of the national minorities.”</p>
<p>Progressive indigenous peoples and Moros backed Duterte on his statements last year against the war crimes committed by the US against the Moros, as well as his pronouncements to respect the indigenous peoples’ right to ancestral lands.</p>
<p>Sandugo staged protests in Quezon City and Cotabato City today, July 21, three days before Duterte’s second State of the Nation Address (SONA) on July 24.</p>
<p>Lumad students and teachers from Caraga region and Davao del Norte joined indigenous peoples from Luzon and student advocates in the protest at the Boy Scout Circle in Timog, Quezon City. In Cotabato City, Maguindanao province, Moros and Lumad joined the protest.</p>

<p>“In just one year, 24 indigenous peoples and Moros were killed by this regime. Paramilitary groups continue to sow terror and attack schools,” said Piya Macliing-Malayao, Sandugo co-convenor and secretary general of Katribu.</p>
<p>She added that some 400,000 indigenous peoples had been displaced by military operations under Duterte, including those caught in the crisis in Marawi city.</p>
<p>Aside from the military attacks, the ancestral lands of minorities continue to be threatened by development aggression projects for mining, plantations and power.</p>

<p>“Coupled with escalating militarization of our land and territories, he has continued the anti-people and pro-foreign economic policies of the previous regimes. We still face the continued threat of losing our land and territories to destructive mining or vast plantations. The Bangsamoro and the indigenous peoples remain in abject poverty, as real change has not come,” said Aba.</p>
<p>Even as Duterte has scrapped the peace talks with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), Sandugo called for its resumption, to address the roots of the country’s social unrest. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>MANILA – The University of the Philippines-Diliman welcomed a group of Lumad who arrived from Mindanao today, July 20, in time to join the big rally on President Duterte’s State of the Nation Address (SONA) this Monday, July 24.</p>
<p>Forty-seven Lumad, most of whom are youth and students from the Caraga region, are the first of <em>Lakbayanis</em> &#8212; members of the major protest caravan of indigenous peoples and Moro, the <em>Lakbayan</em> 2017 set to come to Metro Manila this coming September. A hundred more Lumad are expected to arrive from Southern Mindanao on July 23 to join the SONA protest. </p>

<p>Progressive youth groups and staff in UP’s flagship campus officially welcomed the Lakbayanis during a short program at Quezon Hall. The Lumad will be staying at UPD’s International Center until September for the Lakbayan. </p>
<p>Kenneth Cadiang, volunteer teacher for Alternative Learning Center for Agricultural and Livelihood Development or ALCADEV, thanked the UP community and the other sectors that accommodated them readily in UP Diliman. Far from UPD’s warm welcome, however, Cadiang shared their group’s experience getting out of Mindanao with the tight security because of martial law. </p>
<p>“Patuloy pa rin ang harassment [mula sa militar], kahit verbal harassment, intimidation, at interrogation,” Cadiang said, “Pero syempre kami, patuloy naman kami sa pagpapaliwanag sa kanila.”<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;As long as there is conflict, and as long as there is struggle from the masses, the government and state must always listen.”</p>
<p><strong>By GINO ESTELLA</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA – For many who marched on the streets of Quezon City on President Duterte’s first State of the Nation Address (Sona), it was the glaring heat of the sun and proximity to congress that marked the day. </p>
<p>For some, it was a culmination – the destination of several days of tireless protest, a historic occasion where they can finally be heard.  </p>
<p>Unlike in the past years, marchers on July 25 were greeted with handshakes and ice candy from police, as they made a monumental right turn inching less than a kilometer away from the Sona’s venue at the Batasang Pambansa complex.</p>
<p>Massing up in Metro Manila, progressive groups pushed for the People’s Agenda, a 15-point program for pro-people and pro-nation policies to address the roots of poverty.</p>
<p>This mobilization also marked the end of the July Manilakbayan, which brought delegates from several regions to forward local issues and concerns to the country’s center of government. </p>
<p>Bicol Region had the largest contingent with 3,700, and 3,000 came from the island of Mindanao; thousands also travelled from Southern Tagalog, Central and Northern Luzon. The 30,000-strong crowd was in high spirits, many ignored their sunburnt skin and the blisters on their feet. </p>
<p>While rallyists grew energetic during the program held in front of Batasan Hills National High School, 42-year-old Amelia Cabaña of Camarines Sur quietly sat on the entrance of a jeepney.  </p>
<p>“We went to the president&#8217;s Sona because we want to hear the promises of his new administration,&#8221; Cabaña said. The Bicol contingent travelled for two days, reaching Manila two days before the Sona.<br />
<figure id="attachment_92305" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/sona-kaluhhamin-women-by-loi/"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SONA-kaluhhamin-women-by-loi.jpg" alt="(Photo by Carlo Manalansan/Bulatlat)" width="960" height="635" class="size-full wp-image-92305" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(Photo by Carlo Manalansan/Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure><br />
The mostly-peasant contingent travelled, enduring hunger and sleepless nights. She recalls a “strict” diet of <em>tuyo,</em> (dried fish) and tireless days of walking. They were accommodated in the University of the Philippines-Diliman, where several build-up protests were held before the People’s Sona.</p>
<p>Her family resides in a farmland close to the Bicol National Park, a 5,201-hectare park straddling Camarines Sur and Camarines Norte. But with the implementation of the former Aquino regime’s National Greening Program, they are constantly under threat of being displaced.</p>
<p>She is one of the many peasants at risk of losing their inherited land to the hands of large corporate businesses with legal claims. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) pressed charges and ordered them to leave the grounds of the park.</p>
<p>“We have been living there for years, and our parents have grown old there as well,” Cabaña said in Filipino, “Police come to our houses and tell us to leave; it scares our children and they could not study.”</p>
<p>Residents have been charged with illegal logging or timber theft, she said. The Bicol government has continuously asked them to leave since the administration revived its reforestation effort in 2010.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want the president to hear about the harassment the DENR has been doing to us,&#8221; she said in Filipino. &#8220;We want him to look at us, because our situation has become dire.&#8221; </p>
<p>She said she will not hesitate to join another Sona rally next year. “This is my first time, but we will return until our calls have been heard,” she said in Filipino. </p>
<p>Tears fell past the sunglasses she used to conceal her eyes, and she stopped eating to tell more of their plight in Bicol. Her companions looked at her with concern, all of them wanting to console her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we adults have the capacity to survive by the day,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But we do not want our children to scamper around in the rain because they do not have a roof over their heads.&#8221;<br />
The issue of homes and land being lost is not limited to the peasants of Bicol. The generations-long struggle for ancestral lands is also being drumbeat by the Lumad from Mindanao.</p>
<p>Kerlan Fanagel, the chairperson of PASAKA-SMR, a confederation of Lumad organizations in southern Mindanao, is one of the leaders in the People’s SONA. He sat near the stage, along with other Lumad delegates in their traditional attire, which they have worn to make themselves known in the protest.</p>
<p>The Lumad lakbayanis began their travel on July 19, and reached Manila on July 23, and stayed at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines in Sta. Mesa, Manila. </p>
<p>Fanagel, a Blaan, is no stranger to “bakwit,” a term the Lumad have become accustomed to, as they <em>bakwit</em> (evacuate) temporarily from their lands when their lives are threatened.</p>
<p>He said evacuations have been triggered by the massive operations of the Armed Forces of the Philippines’ (AFP), which has deployed 60 percent of their forces in Mindanao regions. Several Lumad groups still remain in evacuation centers, with 2,000 Manobo in Surigao del Sur, and 400 at the evacuation center in the Haran chapter of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines in Davao City.<br />
<figure id="attachment_92306" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/sona-stop-militarization-by-loi/"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SONA-stop-militarization-by-loi.jpg" alt="(Photo by Carlo Manalansan/Bulatlat)" width="960" height="635" class="size-full wp-image-92306" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SONA-stop-militarization-by-loi.jpg 960w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SONA-stop-militarization-by-loi-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SONA-stop-militarization-by-loi-768x508.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(Photo by Carlo Manalansan/Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure><br />
The large military concentration in Mindanao is part of the Aquino administration’s counterinsurgency program Oplan Bayanihan.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are united in this mass movement because we want the president to know about the Mindanao People&#8217;s Agenda,&#8221; Fanagel said in Filipino. He said they are calling for the pullout of soldiers encamped in Lumád schools and communities.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are calling for the dissolution of paramilitary groups that continue to destroy our schools and harrass our teachers,&#8221; Fanagel said. The murder of many Lumad leaders were also attributed to paramilitary groups, that were trained and armed by the military.</p>
<p>Days before the Sona, on July 18, <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2016/07/16/lumad-leader-shot-dead-in-davao-city/" target="_blank">armed men riding in tandem shot dead Herme Alegre,</a> president of the PTCA of the Salugpungan School, and critically wounded Datu Danny Diarog  in Davao City.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want our Lumád brothers and sisters to go home, but the schools and the communities have all been wrecked,&#8221; Fanagel said in Filipino. “There is no livelihood there, and the community is ruined.”</p>
<p>Fanagel said the evacuees should also be given relief and rehabilitation to help them rebuild their farms and communities.  </p>
<p>This is not the first time for a big Mindanao contingent to set foot in Metro Manila to bring their plight. In 2015, some 800 <em>lakbayanis</em> travelled to the capital to protest against the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in Manila. For the People’s Sona, they again travelled 1,000 kilometers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is only one of the sacrifices that we continue to endure as Mindanaoan,&#8221; Fanagel said in Filipino. &#8220;This is to further assert our rights and strengthen our calls and voices, so Malacañang hears us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In all our mobilizations and mass movements, there are always victories,” Fanagel said in Filipino. </p>
<p>In his Sona, Duterte declared a unilateral ceasefire of military operations against the New People’s Army (NPA). The Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) has since declared it will reciprocate. Both moves are part of trust-building efforts as the peace talks between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP) and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) resumes in August.<br />
<figure id="attachment_92403" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/sona-sili-by-loi/"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SONA-sili-by-loi.jpg" alt="(Photo by Carlo Manalansan/Bulatlat)" width="960" height="635" class="size-full wp-image-92403" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SONA-sili-by-loi.jpg 960w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SONA-sili-by-loi-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/SONA-sili-by-loi-768x508.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(Photo by Carlo Manalansan/Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure><br />
“Victories we must defend with our participation, organization and recruitment,&#8221; Fanagel said.<br />
It was a mobilization not met by police batons striking skulls, nor by water cannons firing murky water from fire trucks. This day in history saw many firsts, as the nation saw hope in a president that may possibly enact policies that are for them.</p>
<p>The People’s Sona was also a commencement, a moving-up event to further advance the interests of the people. Perhaps it was amplified this year, that activists hold rallies and mobilizations because they demand to be heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as there is conflict, and as long as there is struggle from the masses, the government and state must always listen,” Fanagel said.  <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat " src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p><strong>By KAREN ANN MACALALAD</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA –  July 25 was a historic event, as the 30,000-strong contingent of peasants, workers, indigenous peoples, professionals, urban poor, students and various sectors marched to the House of Representatives in Quezon City, without battling through barbed wires and policemen with truncheons, to amplify their calls and the people’s agenda in time for President Rodrigo Duterte’s first State of the Nation Address (Sona).</p>
<p>Yesterday’s rally was highlighted by a lot of superlatives and firsts: it had the biggest contingent from the regions, including some 8,000 peasants, indigenous people and urban poor from Mindanao and Bicol; it was the first rally to have a six-panel mural instead of an effigy; it was most peaceful and tension-free, as police allowed marchers to go near the Batasang Pambansa complex, where the first Mindanaoan president delivered the Sona, which, for the first time, gave the marchers something to cheer about.</p>
<p>At the end of the rally, and just when they least expected it,rally leaders were invited – for the first time – inside Congress to talk to the President.<br />

“Today is historic because it tells how the people stood against the six-year disaster of the Aquino administration. Our participation shows the failure of his (counter-insurgency program) Oplan Bayanihan in Mindanao,” said Bai Ali Indayla, spokesperson of people’s caravan Manilakbayan 2016.</p>
<p>The continuous mass campaigns by peoples organizations, as well as the tactical offensive operations by the revolutionary movement, shook former president Benigno Aquino III’s term, proof of how the “reactionary” government can never address the needs of the people in Mindanao, she added.<br />

Rallyists brought big murals that depict the 15-point People’s Agenda on economic development, good governance, social policy, peace and human rights and foreign policy. The five-hour program featured each sector’s demands and struggles.</p>
<p><strong>Calls to end poverty and injustice</strong></p>
<p>Primary in the rallyists’ calls is the resumption of peace talks between the government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), which, they said, can help end the centuries-long issue of poverty and oppresion. The negotiations began in 1986, but never progressed beyond the ceasefire agreement. Talks finally collapsed in early 1987, after the Mendiola Massacre that killed 13 farmers, and the Lupao Massacre in Nueva Ecija.<br />

“Peace has a direct relation to the lives of the people – if there is hunger, there is no peace,” said Rev. Ramil Aguilar of Iglesia Filipina Independiente. Peace is dependent on justice and should be fought hard for by the people, he said.</p>
<p>Aside from the resumption of the negotiations, the groups also called for the release of political prisoners, including the 18 NDFP peace consultants. </p>
<p>“It is not a crime to assert other people’s rights and join the movement for societal change. The political prisoners were once leaders of organizations- our voice for land distribution, higher wages and lasting peace,” said Nikki Gamara, daughter of detained NDFP consultant Renante Gamara.<br />
<figure id="attachment_92381" style="width: 2987px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/_mg_2047/"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MG_2047.jpg" alt="Nikki Gamara, daughter of an detained NDFP consultant Renante Gamara (Photo by Karen Ann Macalalad/Bulatlat)" width="2987" height="1991" class="size-full wp-image-92381" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MG_2047.jpg 2987w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MG_2047-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MG_2047-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MG_2047-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MG_2047-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 2987px) 100vw, 2987px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Nikki Gamara, daughter of an detained NDFP consultant Renante Gamara (Photo by Karen Ann Macalalad/Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure><br />
Also foremost in the People’s Agenda are free land distribution to tillers, and national industrialization, which will create more local jobs and achieve social justice for the people, they said. </p>
<p>Land reform goes hand-in-hand with national industrialization to increase food production, explained Jerome Adonis, secretary-general of labor group Kilusang Mayo Uno. He also cited the importance of rebuilding the country’s steel industry to develop the transportation and communication systems without depending on foreign companies.</p>
<p><strong>Continuing struggle</strong></p>
<p>“All of us want peace, not the peace of the dead, but the peace of the living. We express our willingness and readiness to go to the negotiating table, and yet we load our guns, fix our sights, pull the trigger,” President Duterte said in his state of the nation address.</p>
<p>As he came to the part declaring a unilateral ceasefire in the government’s operations against the New People’s Army, the rallyists broke into applause and cheers. The crowd also cheered when Duterte mentioned lowering of personal income tax rates.<br />
<figure id="attachment_92384" style="width: 3237px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/_mg_1928/"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MG_1928.jpg" alt="Lumad and Moro communities join the People&#039;s State of the Nation Address.

(Photo by Karen Ann Macalalad/Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure><br />
The government’s intention to resume the peace talks and end the armed struggle is clear, said Renato Reyes Jr., secretary-general of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan. “The effectivity of the ceasefire can be measured by the return of our brother Lumad to their communities. The Armed Forces of the Philippines should pull-out their forces from the Lumad’s schools and ancestral lands,” he said.</p>
<p>However, Reyes lamented President Duterte’s statement on continuing current macroeconomic policies. “The president has not cited any specific policies but we call to end the Public-Private Partnership program (of Aquino) and liberalization of the economy,” he said.</p>
<p>Reyes also denounced the continuing extrajudicial killings, including those of drug suspects, and called for due process. Under the Aquino government, 294 victims of extrajudicial killings were recorded by human rights group Karapatan.<br />
<figure id="attachment_92382" style="width: 2779px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/_mg_2146/"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MG_2146.jpg" alt="Renato Reyes Jr. of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Photo by Karen Ann Macalalad/Bulatlat)" width="2779" height="1852" class="size-full wp-image-92382" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MG_2146.jpg 2779w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MG_2146-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MG_2146-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MG_2146-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MG_2146-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 2779px) 100vw, 2779px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Renato Reyes Jr. of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Photo by Karen Ann Macalalad/Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure><br />
Reyes reminded the rallyists to remain vigilant since the alliance with the government does not guarantee that there would be 100 percent agreements on the economic, social, and political reforms and direction needed by Philippine society. </p>
<p>“Our fight goes on and we won’t bring down our banners,” Reyes said.<br />

<p>Many urban poor pin their hopes on President Duterte’s plan to improve the country.</p>
<p><strong>By ANNE MARXZE D. UMIL</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA &#8212; President Rodrigo Roa Duterte may have won the hearts of the Filipino electorate, but his State of the Nation Address (Sona) has fallen short of details on aspects concerning ordinary folk. These include education, jobs and better work condition, protection of their right to due process.</p>
<p><em>Bulatlat</em> interviewed ordinary folk around Batasan Road before Duterte gave his speech on July 25.</p>
<p><strong>Housing, space for livelihood</strong></p>
<p>Single parent Myrna Celita, 54, has one child whom she worked her finger to the bone to send through college, selling a myriad of products, from flowers to banana que and carioca. Her daughter finished computer science but only found a job in a mall. Although her daughter has graduated, Celita still helps out to send to school her grandchildren, nephews and nieces. She hoped Duterte would scrap the K to 12 program. </p>
<p>“I really wanted that program to be stopped. Life is very difficult. We have struggled with the 10 year-education, how much more for 12 years?” she told <em>Bulatlat</em> in an interview. She said many parents cannot even support their children, many of whom end up as drop-outs,” she added.<br />
President Duterte, however, did not mention the K to 12 program in his Sona.</p>
<p>Celita also wishes that the Duterte administration provides free housing to the poor. She and her daughter rent a house in Bagong Silangan village in Quezon City. She laments that what they earn only goes to pay for rent. There was also a threat of demolition of their community. </p>
<p>Celita saw Duterte’s sincerity in going after criminals and noted that there was change after he won, as police go after drug peddlers. She was all for the elimination of crime as her nieces in the province were all victims of rape by their own father. She voted for Duterte because she really wanted criminals to be punished. “I voted for Duterte for justice for all victims of violence,” she said.</p>
<p>Romeo Resare, 38, a pineapple vendor, has been selling along Batasan for the past three years. He hopes that Duterte lets street vendors like him sell and make a living without being harassed. </p>
<figure id="attachment_92344" style="width: 762px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/lunesa-jennifer.jpg"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/lunesa-jennifer.jpg" alt="Lunesa Lubacarte and Jennifer Mondejar, both vendors joined the People&#039;s Sona in Batasan, Quezon City. (Photo by A. Umil/ Bulatlat) " width="762" height="1024" class="size-full wp-image-92344" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/lunesa-jennifer.jpg 762w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/lunesa-jennifer-223x300.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 762px) 100vw, 762px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Lunesa Lubacarte and Jennifer Mondejar, both vendors joined the People&#8217;s Sona in Batasan, Quezon City. (Photo by A. Umil/ Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure>
<p>“We are still being apprehended by authorities. I do look forward to change so that all could live a comfortable life, not just those who are in power,” he said. </p>
<p>Resare said he voted for Duterte because he hails from Mindanao, while other Philippine presidents came from Luzon and Visayas. <em>“Iba naman,</em> (For a change)” he said. He believed in Duterte’s promise to end criminality in six months and that he would indeed bring change in the country.<br />
Two vendors from Manila also went to the People’s Sona in Batasan. With them are not only their placards but also umbrellas &#8212; not in preparation for the rain, but to sell.</p>
<p>Lunesa Lucaberte, 47, of Parola, Tondo hopes that Duterte would allow street vendors to continue with their livelihood. Her family has a sari-sari store in Luneta Park, where they have been selling for the past 10 years. However, they are being evicted from the park because of the local government’s clearing operations. Selling is their primary source of income. </p>
<p>“We have nowhere else to go,” Lucaberte said. </p>
<p>Jennifer Mondejar, 43, has a similar problem. She was among the vendors in Divisoria, Manila whose stalls were evicted by the clearing operations last week. She has eight children; six of them are in their province in Mindanao and the other two are with her in Tondo. She is a single parent.<br />
Mondejar went to the province last elections to bring her kids to her family, and also to vote for Duterte. Making a living in the province is more difficult, she said so she came back with her two children to Manila, where she has lived for 20 years. With her stall gone, she roams Divisoria to sell goods to bring food on the table.  </p>
<p>“I do hope that he will help us. Especially with our condition now that I have no place to sell,” she said. </p>
<p>In his Sona, Duterte spoke of “jobs that are suitable for the poor and less skilled members of the workforce,” as well as the development of agriculture, tourism and manufacturing. For the abovementioned small vendors, they can just hope that it would include better conditions for those who sell on the streets.</p>
<p><strong>Urban poor group supports in-city relocation, rehabilitation for drug suspects</strong></p>
<p>In a statement, urban poor group Kadamay said they were “disheartened” that Duterte’s Sona said nothing about ending contractualization, which had plagued many workers.</p>
<p>They, however, “welcomed” Duterte’s earlier statement that there will be no demolitions without relocation of informal settlers, as well as what he said in the Sona said about requiring utility companies to install water and electricity in relocation and depressed areas. The group also noted his statement for developing industries to create jobs for sustainable communities.</p>

(By A. Umil/ Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Kadamay noted that the President should also look into the Urban Development and Housing Act (Udha), which has been “the main legal justification” in enforcing demolitions. </p>
<p>“Informal settler families in Quezon City, Cebu, Batangas and Davao have been tossed aside to the gutters in favor of big business and the interests of local government authorities,” the group said. It added that eviction “should be at the bottom of the list of options if we are to endeavor for genuine on-site and community development.” </p>
<p>On Duterte’s order to the police to “triple” their operations against drugs, Kadamay said these should be done with respect for suspects’ right to due process, “as part of his (Duterte’s) commitment to human rights.”</p>
<p>“We call on both the PNP and the President to sincerely account for the staggering number of deaths of those merely being suspected of drug-related activities. Whether vigilantes or rogue actions of police, urban poor Filipinos are fast becoming the primary target.</p>
<p>The group said the government’s war on drugs should be in the whole context of combatting poverty. There should also be reorientation of the police, and provision of rehabilitation services for drug addicts as part of basic social services. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“It is one step, but government should also pull out soldiers, hold human rights violators accountable, and allow evacuees to go  home and reestablish their livelihood, schools and communities.”</p>
<p><strong>By DEE AYROSO</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA – Indigenous peoples were among the many rallyists outside Batasang Pambansa who cheered when President Duterte declared a unilateral ceasefire in his July 25 State of the Nation Address (SONA). But they said it should also mean the pullout of soldiers and disbanding of paramilitary groups in communities.</p>
<p>“This is one step towards justice, and it should come with the immediate pullout of soldiers from communities in Surigao del Sur, Davao del Norte and Bukidnon,” said Piya Macliing-Malayao, secretary general of the Kalipunan ng Katutubong Mamamayan ng Pilipinas (Katribu). She said it would mean the return home of indigenous peoples-evacuees.</p>
<p>Some 5,000 indigenous Lumád have been staying for almost a year in evacuation centers in Tandag City, Surigao del Sur and at the Haran Center of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines in Davao City. The <em>bakwets</em> (evacuees) left their homes last year after harassment by soldiers and paramilitary groups. In Lianga, Surigao del Sur, the deployment of soldiers and paramilitary men was a prelude to the killing of two Manobo leaders and a school director.</p>
<p>“It (ceasefire) is one step, but government should also pull out soldiers, hold human rights violators accountable, and allow evacuees to go  home and reestablish their livelihood, schools and communities,” Malayao told <em>Bulatlat</em> after listening to Duterte’s speech at the SONA rally.</p>
<p>“This has taken a long-time coming, because the Lumád have long called for justice,” she added.</p>
<p><strong>’Disband paramilitary groups’</strong></p>
<p>Among the thousands of rallyists who came to Manila from Mindanao is <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/11/03/kulamanon-datu-longs-to-farm-again-with-sons/" target="_blank">Datu Camilo Asunan, a Manobo tribal chief of White Culaman village in Kitaotao, Bukidnon,</a> whose stay at the Haran center turns one year on Aug. 26. Asunan was arrested and detained by police along with 12 other residents based on trumped-up charges. He sought sanctuary in Davao as soon as he was freed.</p>
<p>“If there will be a ceasefire, they should pull out soldiers. Because if they are still in the communities, (the ceasefire) is useless,” Asunan told <em>Bulatlat.</em> He said paramilitary groups should be disbanded.</p>
<p>He added: “The soldiers may follow the ceasefire, but the paramilitary don’t have to.”</p>
<p>Asunan said they recently learned that a paramilitary group called “Empahalad” – the Manobo word for “offering” – have been trained by soldiers of the Philippine Army Special Forces and 8th Infantry Battalion who are encamped in White Culaman. At least 24 trainees have been recruited, including some of his relatives.<br />

<p>“They don’t know the law, they are not even being claimed by the military, so that if they kill somebody, the soldiers are not charged, only the paramilitary,” Asunan said.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bakwets</em> hope to return home</strong></p>
<p>Students Menirose de Castro and Jesren Miniel, students of the Alternative Center for Agricultural and Livelihood Development (Alcadev) in Lianga, Surigao del Sur, were also at the SONA rally. They were among the thousands of Manobos who evacuated from Diatagon village on Sept. 1 last year, after the paramilitary Magahat-Bagani men killed their school director Emerito Samarca, Dionel Campos of the Malahutayong Pakigbisog Alang sa Sumusunod (Mapasu), and Datu Juvello Sinzo.</p>
<p>“Among us youth, there is now hope that our problems will be solved,” said De Castro, 16. She said Mapasu leader Eufemia Cullamat was among the progressive leaders who met with Duterte after his June 30 inauguration. </p>
<p><em>“Makakauwi na raw kami, kailangan lang makipagtulungan</em>(We will be able to come home, we just have to work with them),” she recalled their leader’s words.</p>
<p>Rius Valle of the Save our Schools Network said many Lumád evacuees in Haran in Davao City are also optimistic that with President Duterte at the country’s helm, they will soon head home.</p>
<p>“He (Duterte) is close to the Lumád and he has never let us down,” Valle said. Valle is one of the so-called “Haran 15”&#8211; the 15 Lumád leaders and progressives who were charged with kidnapping and illegal detention of the Haran evacuees. The Department of Justice junked the charges against them on July 19.<br />

Valle cited a 2014 dialogue by Davao del Norte evacuees with Duterte, then Davao City mayor, which led to the withdrawal of soldiers from Talaingod. However, the soldiers returned after a month. Still, the Lumád hope to have a chance to talk to the President, so they can come home. </p>
<p>“Based on their experience, he listens to their demands, and respects their calls. That is how hopeful they are,” Valle said.</p>
<p><strong>’Bring perpetrators to justice’</strong></p>
<p>Malayao said government must also hold accountable and bring to justice the perpetrators of the killings and attacks on indigenous communities, specially identified paramilitary men, soldiers and commanding officers. </p>
<p>“Although there is emphasis in Mindanao, because of the Lumád killings, there is also repression on indigenous peoples in Zinundungan Valley in Rizal town, Cagayan province, where there is an increased number of progressives charged with trumped-up cases, which goes along with the increased protest of indigenous peoples to protect their land,” she said.</p>
<p>At least 76 individuals, including <a href="http://www.nordis.net/2015/10/statements-drop-the-charges-vs-the-cagayan-76/" target="_blank">indigenous peoples of Zinundungan Valley, were charged with kidnapping and homicide in 2015.</a></p>
<p>At the evacuation at the Surigao del Sur provincial capitol, Miniel said, a large number of drug suspects have surrendered or were caught by police. He and De Castro said they hoped the police will have the same tenacity in running after the paramilitary men and soldiers who colluded to kill the three Lianga martyrs.</p>
<p>“We call on Duterte to help us bring those criminals to justice,” De Castro said.<a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat " src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>
