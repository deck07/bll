<p>MANILA- Indigenous people, women, and youth groups marched to various government offices on Tuesday to condemn the extension of Martial Law and the US military intervention in the country.    </p>
<p>According to a statement from Save Our Schools, the decision of the Supreme Court is a blatant disregard of its mandate of protecting the interest of the Lumad people and their communities. Students from Mindanao wrote letters addressed to the Supreme Court justices stating their “anger and disappointment” over the decision.</p>
<p>Apart from the Supreme Court, members of Save Our Schools Mindanao, Kasalo-CARAGA and other Mindanao-based organizations also held protest actions before the Department of Justice and the United States embassy, where they assailed its role in human rights abuses.</p>

<p>“US Aggression in this new millennium is embodied by Martial Law in Mindanao, counter-insurgency programs such as Oplan Kapayapaan, and the bloody Oplan Tokhang,” said  League of Filipino Student chairperson Kara Tagaoa.</p>
<p>Tagaoa also criticized lopsided deals with the United States such as the Mutual Defense Treaty, the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, the Mutual Logistics Support Agreement, and the Visiting Forces Agreement as new forms of colonial imposition of US interest over Philippines.</p>
<p>Groups will march again on March 8 during International Women’s Day celebration at Mendiola, Liwasang Bonifacio and Luneta.</p>

<p>Led by the Alpha Phi Omega (APO) Fraternity &#8211; Eta Chapter, the APO Fraternity’s University of the Philippines Diliman (UPD) Chapter, the naked runners wore masks with covered mouths while carrying blank wooden placards as they staged their annual tradition at the UP Diliman Palma Hall. An LCD screen featured videos and photos of known UP personalities and leaders holding placards with the various messages and demands being campaigned for by their respective sectors. Among them were UP Faculty Regent Bomen Guillermo, UP Student Regent Ivy Taroma, UPD Chancellor Michael Tan, All UP Academic Employees Union national president Carl Ramota, and journalist and newly-appointed United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) National Goodwill Ambassador Atom Araullo.</p>

<p>According to the APO spokespersons, the masks and placards symbolize their calls, and the Oblation Run, a tradition that began in 1977 during the Marcos dictatorship as an effective form of protest, amplifies the people’s demands and issues. They also called on the public to become more vigilant, critical, and involved in people’s issues in order to bring about social justice, freedom and progress for all. <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">MANILA &#8212; Workers from government agencies staged a nationwide black ribbon-wearing today to condemn what they call as unjustified delay of the 2019 budget. It has affected social services including the implementation of mandated salary increases.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Some members of Congress and the Department of Budget and Management, headed by Secretary Benjamin Diokno, have differences about the “corruption-laden” P3.757T national budget.  Ferdinand Gaite, COURAGE National President, said their infighting to obtain a bigger piece of the pie has delayed the budget approval. Gaite said President Rodrigo Duterte has worsened this infighting by allowing some members of Congress to grasp a larger portion of the “parked” funds in government agencies such as the DPWH.  &#8220;This is the obvious reason why the General Appropriations Act for 2019 was not approved during the previous session of Congress and thus the re-enactment of the previous 2018 budget,&#8221; Gaite said.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-105955" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/state_2men.jpg" alt="Courage" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/state_2men.jpg 800w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/state_2men-487x365.jpg 487w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/state_2men-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Sec. Diokno warned the delay in Congress&#8217; budget approval will affect the budget for education, housing, health and other social services. Even the last tranche of salary adjustment for government civilian and military personnel will be affected, but House Majority Leader Rolando Andaya, Jr. is disputing this.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Courage estimates that under a re-enacted budget it is more likely that services will be affected and that there will be no salary increase because the budget for these items are in the pending 2019 budget and not in old budget.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Santiago Dasmariñas, Jr., president of the National Federation of Employees Associations in the Department and in Agriculture (NAFEDA), blames the budget delay on government officials &#8220;asserting their selfish interest  and also on wrong budget policies.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Remember the corruption involving the alleged P52 billion of the 2019 proposed budget reserved  for certain members of Congress?&#8221; Dasmariñas asked. This, he said, was on top of the &#8220;reduction&#8221; or loss from the actual P3.767T budget in 2018 to P3.324T in 2019 due to the shift to “cash-based”  budgeting from obligation-based.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Andaya alleges that Diokno’s in-laws in construction companies have cornered more than P10B worth  of DPWH projects in Bicol.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;These allegations must be fully investigated and heads should roll if proven true,&#8221; Dasmariñas said.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-105956" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/state_3women-840x630.jpg" alt="Courage" width="728" height="546" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/state_3women-840x630.jpg 840w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/state_3women-487x365.jpg 487w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/state_3women-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/state_3women.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Manny Baclagon, President of the Social Workers Employees Association of the Philippines, DSWD, said the government should not only give the workers the last tranche of salary increase but also their demand for a national minimum wage of P16,000 for government employees. The current minimum wage of  P10,510 which will increase to a mere P11,068 by January 2019 is still very far from the family living wage of more than P35,250.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, January 15,  at 12nn-1pm at the House of Representatives&#8217; gate, the government employees are set to launch a protest action to demand for their salary increase.</p>

<p>Defend Job Philippines expressed its support and said that it stands with the motorcycle riders who lose their livelihood due to the TRO. “We stand with the ROTP and the almost 25,000 Angkas bikers, their families and their fellow motorcycle riders on their just demand in defending their rights to decent livelihood, especially in time for the Christmas season,” Defend Job said in a statement.</p>

<p>The group calls on President Duterte’s government and the High Court to lift the TRO which “in effect suppresses their source of income. The lifting of the TRO would also help out the thousands of Angkas commuters, who were depending on the app service for faster means of transportation.”</p>

The SC decision released on Dec. 5 issued a temporary restraining order against the ruling of the Mandaluyong City Regional Trial Court prohibiting the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) from interfering with the operations of Angkas. The ruling of the Mandaluyong RTC has allowed Angkas to resume its operation in September or 10 months after the government also halted their operation. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>Days leading to the commemoration of the International Human Rights Day, an urban poor group slammed the cornerstone of President Rodrigo Duterte&#8217;s economic program &#8211; the Build Build Build program &#8212; as a government initiative that will leave Filipinos both homeless and poorer.</p>
<p>In a protest action today in Mendiola, Kadamay said the infrastructure projects will only lead to demolition of houses, without decent relocation offers to affected residents.</p>
<p>Kadamay chairperson Gloria Arellano said more than half a million Filipinos stand to lose their homes and livelihoods to give way to these infrastructure projects.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/kadamay-02.jpg"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/kadamay-02.jpg" alt="" width="454" height="960" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-105637" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/kadamay-02.jpg 454w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/kadamay-02-173x365.jpg 173w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/kadamay-02-397x840.jpg 397w" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Who will benefit? The Chinese businesses and other capitalists and cronies of demolition king Duterte,&#8221; added Arellano.</p>
<p>Apart from the demolition, the urban poor leader pointed out that the poor will bear the brunt of Build Build Build project as this will be funded through the infamous tax reform program.</p>
<p>The irony, Arellano said, is that the poor will in essence fund the demolition of their homes.</p>
<p>Right to housing is one of rights supposedly guaranteed by the state, as stipulated in the UN International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a> </p>

<p>MANILA &#8212; Hundreds of women from different organizations gathered on Sunday morning, Nov. 25 to formally launch One Billion Rising (OBR) 2019 at Luneta Park in Manila. </p>
<p>The event’s theme: Babae ako, Lumalaban sa Abuso.  </p>
<p>Present at the launch was former Bayan Muna Rep. Neri Colmenares who expressed continuing solidarity in eliminating violence against women. </p>
<p>“Men, as part of the problem (of violence against women) should also be part of the solution in this issue. The Makabayan coalition is with you in this fight. Rise! Resist! Unite!” said Colmenares. </p>
<p>Joms Salvador, Gabriela secretary general said there are women and children who are beaten, raped, harassed every day but are ashamed to speak due to victim blaming. Poor women have also deprived of equal labor rights and women peasants are landless. </p>
<p>“And the fact that we have a president whose mouth spills of misogynistic remarks perpetuates impunity.”</p>
<p>Salvador said presence of women from different sectors &#8211; &#8211; human rights defenders, students, workers, urban poor, indigenous peoples is a political statement that Filipino women and people are rising to end VAW, resist misogyny and fascism. </p>

<p>Also on that day is the commemoration of the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. They also remember the killing and political persecution of the Mirabal sisters of the Dominican Republic who bravely fought the Trujillo dictatorship. </p>
<p>OBR was first held in the Philippines in 2013. Since then, OBR was yearly held every Feb. 14th. The OBR is part of an annual global campaign to raise awareness and to demand a stop to violence against women and children.

<p>MANILA – Progressive groups here have assailed the meeting between President Rodrigo Duterte and Chinese president Xi Jinping as a treachery as the agreements signed between the two leaders will not benefit the Filipino people.</p>
<figure id="attachment_105460" style="width: 1848px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/loi-china-layas-02.jpg"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/loi-china-layas-02.jpg" alt="" width="1848" height="1224" class="size-full wp-image-105460" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/loi-china-layas-02.jpg 1848w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/loi-china-layas-02-551x365.jpg 551w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/loi-china-layas-02-768x509.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/loi-china-layas-02-840x556.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1848px) 100vw, 1848px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Photo by Carlo Manalansan/Bulatlat</figcaption></figure>
<p>On Nov. 20, Duterte welcomed the Chinese leader in Manila for a two-day state visit, where they oversaw the signing of at least 29 documents that included agreements on education, culture, infrastructure, among others. These agreements, however, did not sit well with Filipino progressives, who pointed out that it will only lead to the further displacement of indigenous peoples from their ancestral lands. </p>

<p>“Pawning our lands to imperialist countries such as China is a serious crime and may lead to ethnocide &#8211; the extinction of the affected indigenous peoples groups and the death of our people,” indigenous people’s group Katribu said in a statement. </p>
<p>A protest action was held to register their calls. For one, Katribu pointed out that Duterte did not only manifest his “utter negligence” in upholding the interests of the Filipino people but has also betrayed them. </p>

<p>“Duterte projects himself to be strong but his bravado is useless and lacks the political will to assert national sovereignty and establish a national industry and a self-reliant economy. Clearly, Duterte is proud and willing to be servile to the whims not only to his US masters but also to his Chinese masters,” the group said. </p>
<p>Critics have long noted Duterte’s apparent lack of political will to uphold the country’s sovereignty in the face of the maritime dispute in the West Philippine Sea that is greatly affecting the lives and livelihoods of fisherfolk. However, they added that apart from the maritime dispute, the Chinese government is also pursuing deals that are detrimental to the interests of the people. </p>

<p>Indigenous people’s group Katribu said that Dumagat communities and their supporters continue to resist plans to construct the Kaliwa dam and other dams in the rivers of Sierra Madre, drawing “inspiration from the valiant struggles of indigenous peoples against large dams in the past decades.” </p>
<p>Urban poor group Kadamay has also warned of widespread displacement should the very China-funded “Build Build Build” program.</p>
<p>Katribu vowed to continue their struggle with the people “until genuine democracy and self-determination is achieved.” <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a> </p>
