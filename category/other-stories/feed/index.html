				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">MANILA &#8212; Environment group Kalikasan People’s Network for the Environment warned against &#8220;a possible conflict of interest&#8221; in San Miguel Corporation’s (SMC) recent P1-billion partnership with the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). The green group likens it to a ‘soft payment’ to induce the government agency to fast track reclamation projects of SMC in Manila Bay.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“San Miguel’s P1-billion rehab is highly suspicious because it comes alongside its push for its Aerotropolis and Expressway-Dike reclamation projects across Northern Manila Bay,&#8221; said Leon Dulce, National Coordinator, Kalikasan People’s Network for the Environment (Kalikasan PNE).</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_106722" style="width: 735px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-106722" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bulacan_aerotropolis_direct_hit_onMap.jpg" alt="reclamation of Bulacan coasts" width="735" height="549" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bulacan_aerotropolis_direct_hit_onMap.jpg 735w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bulacan_aerotropolis_direct_hit_onMap-489x365.jpg 489w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bulakan fishing villages/areas to be &#8220;direct hit&#8221; of planned reclamation to pave way for San Miguel Corporations&#8217; airport, real estate, infrastructure projects (map lifted from Silvertides&#8217; presentation during a &#8220;public hearing&#8221; in an evacuation center in Bulakan, Feb 4, 2018.)</figcaption></figure><br />
SMC President and Chief Operating Officer Ramon S. Ang signed on March 4 a five-year agreement with DENR for a comprehensive dredging and clean-up program for the 59.25 kilometer Tullahan River.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We fear that it might serve as ‘greenwashing’ to cover up for SMC&#8217;s destructive projects, at best, or grease money for the railroading of reclamation at worst,” said Dulce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Since last year SMC is processing government  approval of its proposal to develop a 2,500-hectare Aerotropolis in Bulacan province worth P700 Billion. It also has a pending public-private partnership proposal, the Manila Bay Integrated Flood Control and Coastal Defense and Expressway Project, an expressway-dike which covers 18,000 hectares across the northern part of Manila Bay.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Kalikasan PNE said Silvertides Holdings Corporation, SMC’s contractor company for land acquisition, is suspected as responsible for clearing at least 657 mangrove trees in Bulakan municipality without securing an Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) and special tree cutting permit. The company recently claimed it will leave the existing 24.5-hectare mangrove eco-park in Bulakan undisturbed with the proposed construction of the Aerotropolis.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s easy to claim that the Aerotropolis will not affect mangrove parks and forests in Manila Bay but studies show otherwise. An ecosystem valuation case study in Manila Bay revealed how a land reclamation project complete with ecosystem conservation, buffering, and rehabilitation efforts could only generate only up to 49 percent of the area’s original ecosystem services,” explained Dulce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The environmental group challenged the SMC to prove its sincerity in contributing to the rehabilitation of Manila Bay &#8220;by desisting their reclamation projects in Bulacan.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“SMC’s P1-billion is chump change compared to the degree of environment destruction, loss of livelihood, and disaster risks that the Aerotropolis and the Expressway-Dike will cause in communities along Manila Bay” Dulce said.<a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<blockquote><p><strong> </strong>“If anyone had rights over the Manila Bay, it is the Filipino people, and if it is to serve any purpose, it should be for the benefit of the general population, and not an elite few.” &#8212; Makabayan lawmakers</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>By MARYA SALAMAT</strong><br />
<em><a href="http://bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA &#8212; Bucking threats from local government leaders and intermittent military “visibility” in their communities, members of the fisherfolk communities in Bulacan have <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/10/16/planned-bulacan-aerotropolis-to-bring-perpetual-hunger-fisherfolk/">protested the proposed reclamation </a>affecting their homes and fishing grounds. “Buo sa isip ko, kaya namin lumaban (I&#8217;m entirely sure in my mind that we can oppose this),” fisherwoman and spokesperson of Network Opposed to Reclamation in Bulacan Monica Anastacio, 63, told <em>Bulatlat</em> in Filipino.</p>
<p>They have questioned since last year what they considered as initial steps to reclamation, the massive cutting of mangrove trees serving San Miguel Corporation’s proposal to do away with their communities and build an international airport on today’s river and villages. Despite the <a href="http://conceptnewscentral.com/index.php/2018/04/16/anti-bulakan-airport-folks-not-a-joke-to-pile-soil-on-our-fishponds/">support to this project</a> by their local government officials, they organized a Network Opposed to the Aerotropolis and Reclamation in Bulacan on October 2018.</p>
<p>With support of their fishermen, the women comprised the network’s unanimous choice as spokespersons to help convene the rest of the affected villagers for the defense of the bay, and to represent them as well in dialogues or forum in the mainland. They launched the campaign to #SaveTaliptip in early 2018.</p>
<p>Supported by the multisectoral Alyansa para sa Pagtatanggol ng Kabuhayan, Paninirahan at Kalikasan sa Manila Bay (AKAP KA-Manila Bay), the Bulacan fisherfolk launched a petition against reclamation since late 2018.  They sent delegations to various pickets and dialogues held at the national headquarters of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). They spoke at peoples’ conferences on climate change, on land use and food security.</p>
<p>“<em>Malaking kawalan sa lahat pag pumayag tayo tabunan,</em>” (It will be a huge loss for everyone if we agree to reclamation) a priest from the Bulacan Ecumenical Forum who grew up catching fish and seafood in Taliptip told a gathering of residents in Taliptip.</p>

Salamat / Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The communities in Taliptip are united not just in protecting the mangroves but also in opposing moves to displace the fisherfolk in favor of a private company’s reclamation, according to Monica Anastacio, a resident of Taliptip for over 50 years. To them it is not just a call for saving their homes or sources of livelihoods for themselves. They believe other Filipinos in the mainland also stand to lose when the mangroves and the relatively affordable sources of nutritious fish and seafood are buried under concrete.</p>
<p>She has worked with her family in Taliptip saltbeds since she was in grade school. When the salt farms stopped operation in 1990s, she and her husband turned to fishing. The women in these coastal communities are used to working with their husbands, from the saltfarms of decades ago to today’s fishing.</p>

<p>While fishing is traditionally a male occupation in the Philippines, it is not uncommon to see women at work, too, setting traps (for crabs), casting nets, rowing the family’s banca, or selling the fish catch. Some women also go down to the river or out on the bay to catch fish. Some wade into the muddy, shallow loam to catch crabs. These days they add to their responsibilities of taking care of their household and family various tasks toward network-building to turn the rehabilitation of river and the bay to the people’s favor.</p>
<p>Their background of being saltfarmers and fisherfolk speaks of how much food the areas where they live now have contributed and could further contribute to the country’s food needs.</p>
<p>The coastal communities in Bulakan were <a href="http://www.map-abcdf.com.ph/documents/presentations/Agribusiness/Agricultural%20Activities%20and%20Services/06%20Philippine%20Salt%20Industry.pdf">major contributors to the country’s salt sufficiency f</a>or decades. Until 1990s, Bulacan was producing more than a hundred metric tons of salt, equivalent to more than half the country&#8217;s needs. That is, until a combination of the impact of climate change and trade liberalization began eroding the industry to a pale shadow of itself at present. Nowadays, the fisherfolk group Pamalakaya says the government’s approval of reclamation projects also threatens the country’s food security, along with other policies that ultimately shrink the fishing grounds and mangroves and remove the fisherfolk from the coasts.</p>
<p>Facing the threat of displacement due to reclamation, the women of Bulakan are facilitating their organizing and network formation for an organized response. Now they are also finding time to ride their bancas and visit their neighboring fishing communities in hopes of strengthening their network opposing the reclamation of their coastal villages.</p>
<p>Asked why it is the women frequently being sent to represent the fisherfolk in outside forum and dialogues, they replied that the menfolk are working with them and supportive, but the tasks of representation can be squeezed along with their other duties such as taking care of the household, selling the fish catch and procuring supplies.</p>
<p><strong>Threats Not only in Bulacan but along entire Manila Bay</strong></p>
<p>What is threatening to happen in Bulakan and neighboring coastal towns is happening under similar projects around the Philippines, said Jam Pinpin, spokesperson of Pamalakaya.</p>
<p>A total of 43 reclamation projects covering more than 32, 000 hectares are pending throughout the 194, 400-hectare Manila Bay, based on record obtained by Pamalakaya from the Philippine Reclamation Authority (PRA).</p>
<p>In Bulacan the SMC has won over the local government executives. Even as it has yet to conclude a concession agreement with the government (for the proposed airport), its subcontractors are already at work readying the ground for reclamation.  It is now at the final stages in the process of securing an ECC (Environmental Compliance Certificate) that will pave the way to reclamation of over 2,500 hectares. It was suspected to have been behind the massive cutting of old-growth mangroves in April 2018. This month as we write, the residents of nearby villages of Obando posted in Save Taliptip’s social media account that strangers were knocking on their doors asking them the sizes of their house and telling them they will have to leave soon.</p>
<p>In Manila, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) announced last week it will start  dredging in the Baywalk area of the Roxas Boulevard in March, saying it is part of the ongoing rehabilitation drive of Manila Bay.</p>
<p>But national fisherfolk group Pamalakaya warned that the targeted area for dredging also happens to be the area where the 148-hectare Manila Solar City reclamation project that will occupy 3.5 kilometers of Manila Bay’s shoreline will be located.</p>
<p>It brings a bitter déjà vu to the fisherfolk leader. He recalled that shortly before the SM Mall of Asia and Entertainment City establishments in Roxas Boulevard began construction years before, there was also some dredging work that resulted to the displacement of more than 6,000 fishing and urban poor families.</p>
<p>In Cavite, a province south of Manila, the coastal villages of mainly fisherfolk are also in a constant battle to save their community and livelihood. At least four reclamation projects covering hundreds to thousands of hectares of Cavite coastlines are being processed by the Philippine Reclamation Authority.</p>
<p>Unlike in Bulacan where the Manila Bay is still bounded by an expanse of alternating shallow loam/islets, a network of rivers and patches of mangroves, in Cavite, only a thin stretch of the shore remains between the bank that has been cemented for road and real estate development and the Manila Bay. Living on what’s left of this narrow shore the fisherfolk communities organized under Pamalakaya have been protesting reclamation and their demolition. They have suffered at least four incidences of suspected <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2017/04/08/fisherfolk-urban-poor-suspect-deliberate-burning-community/">arson</a>.</p>

<p>In advancing their defense of the bay, they pointed to documents from the government’s Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) itself state that the reclamation projects will have ecological impacts in Manila Bay.</p>
<p>It says that throughout the construction of the various projects, contaminants from dredged sediments will be released, deplete dissolved oxygen, and destroy natural habitats of sardines and mangroves found in Manila Bay.  Once finished, the projects will interfere with the natural tide flow of water in the area and erode the shoreline of nearby beaches. The erosion could cause flooding in nearby low-lying areas especially during a typhoon.</p>
<p>Worse flooding has also been recorded in coastal towns of Bulacan since the reclamation of Manila Bay. The fisherfolk group Pamalakaya urged the government to take heed of its own environmental bureau’s assessment.</p>
<p>Based on the assessment of environmentalists and fisherfolk, the government’s ‘Battle for Manila Bay’ is turning out to be another mock battle for rehabilitation.</p>
<p>“With the recent actions of administration such as justifying reclamation projects and the abrupt issuance of Executive Order 74, or the taking over of the power to approve such projects and command of the Philippine Reclamation Authority (PRA), &#8220;Manila Bay rehabilitation&#8221; is becoming synonymous to &#8220;Manila Bay reclamation,&#8221; said Anakpawis party-list Rep. Ariel Casilao.</p>

<p>Environment Secretary Frank Cimatu denied this just this week. But around the same time he was saying these to reporters, Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada was defending and even extolling the reclamation projects.</p>
<p>Anakpawis’ Casilao said all these are a serving as a challenge for the people to advance a genuine rehabilitation of Manila Bay.</p>
<p>“If anyone had rights over the Manila Bay, it is the Filipino people, and if it is to serve any purpose, it should be for the benefit of the general population, and not an elite few,” read a part of the explanatory note when the Makabayan bloc of partylist lawmakers filed this February 7 the <a href="http://congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/basic_17/HB09067.pdf">House Bill 9067 declaring Manila Bay as Reclamation-free Zone</a>.</p>
<p>The proposed law criticized not only the <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2019/01/20/environmentalists-fisherfolk-denounce-denrs-fake-rehabilitation-of-manila-bay/">duplicity in the Duterte administration’s conduct of “rehabilitating” Manila Bay</a> – Anakpawis Partylist said it’s just a façade for facilitating reclamation and taking the bay away from the people. After years of previous reclamation, the ordinary people’s access now to the famed Manila Bay has been reduced to a few kilometers near Rajah Sulayman – and even there the poor are banned from swimming.</p>
<p>In Cavite, Pamalakaya’s Hicap rued said what used to be miles of cheap sources of clams and mussels are now concrete roads that could have been built elsewhere.</p>
<p>Makabayan lawmakers from Anakpawis, Bayan Muna, Gabriela, ACT and Kabataan Partylist traced how, through years of previous reclamation, “Development” along Manila Bay, has wiped out the mangrove ecosystem, from as broad as 54,000 hectares at the turn of the 20th century, to a measly 794 hectares in 1995.</p>

Salamat / Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure>
<p>“Companies destroy mangroves because they saw no profit in maintaining it,” the Makabayan lawmakers said. And after reclamation the ordinary citizens also lose access to what remains of the bay.</p>
<p>“It is as clear as the blue sky of Manila Bay’s horizon that reclamation has deprived the people of public access,” Makabayan said in seeking to declare Manila Bay as reclamation-free zone.</p>
<p>Last February 22, a broad alliance and watchdog for genuine rehabilitation and against reclamation projects was launched in Malate Church near the last remaining free baywalk in Manila Bay. The watchdog seeks to garner support to declaring Manila Bay as a &#8220;reclamation-free&#8221; zone.</p>
<p>They hope that with the proposed law in Congress and the people’s movement and campaigns, they can refute any ruse of any group or even by the government “that worships profit at the cost of undermining the people’s aspiration for a sincerely-rehabilitated, restored and preserved Manila Bay. <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>MANILA – A theatre worker was arrested by combined members of the Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team and the police in Guindulman, Bohol on Monday, March 4.</p>
<p>Alvin Fortaliza, artistic director of the Bol-anong Artista nga may Diwang Dagohoy (Bansiwag) Bohol Cultural Network was reportedly accosted by the authorities while campaigning for Anakpawis Party-list at Guindulman town market and was immediately brought to detention. Fortaliza was among the names listed in a warrant of arrest for the charge of murder.</p>
<p>The Concerned Artists of the Philippines (CAP) condemned the arrest of Fortaliza saying that artists who are critical of President Duterte’s administration are not spared from being arrested.</p>
<p>“Fortaliza’s arrest happened after the harassment and killings of progressive party-list campaigners in the Visayas region. But this also points to a disturbing shift in the attacks against artists and cultural workers,” the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>According to Humabol, a peasant group in Bohol, Fortaliza was known for his socially relevant performances in and outside the province. His performances depict the lives and aspirations of poor farmers, workers, youth, women and other marginalized sectors. He also conducts theater workshops for youth groups around Central Visayas.</p>
<p>Fortaliza is also a volunteer of Anakpawis Party-list and actively help in its campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;He believes that aside from using arts which he is good at, to amplify people&#8217;s calls, electing officials who truly represent the marginalized in Congress is also another way of advancing their rightful demands like genuine agrarian reform. For this, he untiringly campaigned for Anakpawis Partylist. And while doing this, he was arrested,” the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>The group said that Fortaliza’s arrest brought about by false charges against him are meant to harass, demonize and silence activists who are critical of the government’s policies such as Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Law and Rice Tarrification Law which was recently signed by President Duterte.</p>
<p>“This is also what they did to Nelson Lumantas, Humabol deputy secretary general, who was slapped with poorly concocted murder charges December last year, over an incident that happened almost 20 years ago,” the group said.</p>
<p>Anakpawis Rep. Ariel Casilao demands for the release of Fortaliza. He also said that they will formally inform the Commission on Elections (Comelec) of the harassments and killing of their leaders and members by the state forces. Just recently, a leader of Anakpawis was killed in Pangasinan. Robert Mejia, a leader of Anakpawis and vice president of Bayambang Farmers Association was shot dead on Feb. 19 in Tayug, Pangasinan.</p>
<p>“Activists are not criminals; the criminals are the plunderers, mass murderers, allied with the administration,” said Casilao.</p>
<p>“Why the Duterte regime is targeting artists and cultural workers at this point is clear. A government that is kept afloat by bullying, cover ups, deceit, fake news, falsehoods, red-tagging, rights violations, fascist repression, silence, whitewashing, and organized trolling can only be threatened by art’s potential to speak truth to power and to help unite more people towards collective action,” CAP said in a statement.</p>
<p>The group calls on their fellow artists to support the call for the immediate release of Fortaliza. “Let us not wait for any more of our colleagues from the art and cultural sector to be arrested, assaulted, killed, or disappeared amidst the rising attacks. Let us stand for freedom of expression, human rights, and justice to prevent another dictatorship from rising to power.” <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

Carlos Zarate during the press conference exposing Philippines&#8217; loan agreement with China. (Photo courtesy of Bayan Muna Party-list Facebook page.)</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>By MARA S. GENOTIVA</strong><br />
<em><a href="http://davaotoday.com/">Davao Today</a></em></p>
<p>DAVAO CITY, Philippines – Bayan Muna Party-list raised alarm over “highly unusual” loan agreement between the Philippines and China saying it is a “threat to national security.”</p>
<p>Neri Colmenares, Makabayan’s senatorial bet, was referring to the P3.6 billion loan agreement for the Chico River River Pump Irrigation Project.</p>
<p>It was signed by Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of China Zhao Jianhua on behalf of the Export-Import Bank of China and Department of Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez last April 10, 2018.</p>
<p>Colmenares warned that the said agreement is highly unusual as it allows China to “take over” the country’s ports, airports, and even energy resources “in case of default.</p>
<p>Section 8.1 of the agreement, particularly on “Waiver of Immunity” states that the Philippines “irrevocably waives any immunity” of its patrimonial assets and assets which are for commercial use.</p>
<p>“This means that government properties such as the Batangas ports or any of our ports for that matter, or energy assets of the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM) or Napocor (National Power Corporation), even the LRT and MRT, can be taken over by China in case we fail to pay these hundreds of billions in Chinese loans,” Colmenares said.</p>
<p>Colmenares recalled the case of Sri Lanka in 2017 when it turned over Hambantota port for a 99-year lease to China Merchants Port Holdings Company, a government-owned company, after struggling to pay its debt amounting to more than $8 billion.</p>
<p>He added that this provision cannot be found in loan agreements of the Philippines with other countries.</p>
<p>“China, which has been gobbling up our territories in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) is now being allowed by our very own government to gobble up our territories and public facilities in the mainland. This very unusual agreement violates our Constitution, is a threat to national security and must be voided.”</p>
<p>Another red flag, Colmenares noted, is the requirement being asked from the Department of (DOJ) for the issuance of a certification stipulating that the agreement is constitutional.</p>
<p>With such certification, he pointed out that no one could question the constitutionality of the said agreement in Philippine courts.</p>
<p>He added that the Department of Finance (DOF) has also agreed that any dispute related to the agreement will be filed in a Chinese arbitration body in Beijing using China’s law.</p>
<p>This is contrary to the loan agreements the country has entered into with other countries where both parties agree to follow the international arbitration rules.</p>
<p><em>“Sa ilalim ng loan agreement na ito, pag may dispute tayo with China dun tayo mag file sa arbitration court nila kung saan malamang talo tayo,pero yung panalo natin sa international arbitral tribunal on the West Philippine Sea ay binabale wala nila. Katusuhan yon kasi gusto ng China lagi silang panalo,”</em> he added.</p>
<p>DOF Assistant Secretary Antonio Lambino shrugged off Bayan Muna’s claims saying the agreement was carefully evaluated by the Investment Coordination Committee (ICC), which is composed of the Department of Justice, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the DOF.</p>
<p>In response to Lambino, Colmenares noted: “If the agreement was really vetted as the DOF claims, why did it sign an agreement so lopsided in favor of China containing conditions which are not imposed by other creditor countries and institutions?”</p>
<p>Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate also questioned the confidentiality clause of the agreement which deprived the public of information about the said loan.</p>
<p>Section 8.8 of the agreement states that the Philippines “shall keep all the terms, conditions and the standard fees hereunder or in connection with this Agreement.”</p>
<p><em>“Tayo ang magbabayad ng loan na ito, bakit itatatago sa atin?</em> Our loans with ADB are posted on their website while China’s loans cannot be accessed by the people who will pay for it. This is a deviation from standard international practice,” said Zarate.</p>
<p>Colmenares also slammed DOF’s statement as mere justification to cover up the onerous nature of the said loan agreement.</p>
<p>“The main issue here is that the Philippine government has allowed China to dictate the terms of these loans,” Colmenares said. <strong><em>Reposted by</em></strong> <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>“This series of attacks, bigoted and fantastic as they are, is not only disturbing but can be ominous of even worse things to come.”</p>
<p><strong>By ANNE MARXZE D. UMIL</strong><br />
<em><a href="http://bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA – National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) chairperson Fidel Agcaoili has set the record straight amid allegations that he is part of the National Union of People’s Lawyers (NUPL) to cover up the “legal complaints filed against the New People’s Army.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ndfp.org/setting-the-record-straight/?fbclid=IwAR39UCo8ocJDOL28RzMdf6nwPxQMVK-stl039KfS3d1DKAJ9xrKwi9_MvOg">Agcaoili released a statement</a> after a group called No to Communist Terrorist Group Coalition (NCTGC) accused him of “handling” the legal affairs of the NUPL which the group also accused as front organization of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1063066">Mario Laude, the coalition’s spokesperson, said </a>that NUPL is under Agcaoili’s command to “use it as the shield of the Party against complaints of human rights abuses, legal complaints filed in courts so that top level officials of the CTG (communist terrorist group) could be spared of.” He added that Agcaoili should be held accountable to what they call as “criminal acts” of the revolutionary forces.</p>
<p>“For the record, I am not a lawyer, never had the ambition to be one despite coming from a family of lawyers,” Agcaoili said adding that he has nothing to do with the lawyers’ group.</p>
<p>He said some NUPL lawyers are legal consultants of the NDFP Negotiating Panel and also serve as legal counsels of the detained NDFP consultants and political prisoners. However, Agcaoili said, this does not mean that the NUPL is a so-called front of the CPP or its lawyers are members of the Party.</p>
<p>“In accordance with due process, it is for any court of law, be it revolutionary or reactionary, to determine the truth of such allegations through competent and admissible evidence and not through manufactured witnesses or planted evidence like what is brazenly happening now,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Agcoaili meanwhile warned that such red-tagging of the people&#8217;s lawyers is &#8220;meant to set them up for the kill.&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_98354" style="width: 547px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fva-kodao.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-98354" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fva-kodao-547x365.jpg" alt="" width="547" height="365" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fva-kodao-547x365.jpg 547w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fva-kodao-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fva-kodao-840x560.jpg 840w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fva-kodao-272x182.jpg 272w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fva-kodao.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">National Democratic Front of the Philippines chief negotiator Fidel Agcaoili.

<p>&#8220;But red-tagging has a more sinister objective. It is meant to smear any organization or individual to set them up for the kill, as has been shown in many cases in the past such as those of NDFP consultant Randy Malayao and NUPL lawyer Benjamin Ramos,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><strong>Intensified attacks against people’s lawyers</strong></p>
<p>The NUPL also cried foul over the allegation of Laude and the recent red tagging of lawyers and organizations affiliated with the NUPL. For the past two weeks, the group said, their members have been consistently red-tagged and labeled as members of the underground group Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) – New People’s Army (NPA)-National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP).</p>
<p>Last week, Feb. 22, a list was circulated around Cagayan de Oro in Mindanao tagging NUPL, its affiliate Union of Peoples’ Lawyers in Mindanao (UPLM) and three women lawyers; Beverly Ann Musni Yr. and her two daughters, Czarina and Beverly Musni as members of the CPP-NDFP-NPA.</p>
<p>With the three women lawyers, 19 individuals and four organizations were tagged as communists. The Musnis are actively involved in human rights cases and public interest advocacies.</p>
<p>The Daily Tribune publisher Ninez Cacho-Olivares also blatantly tagged the NUPL and NUPL president Edre Olalia as leftists and “commies” in her <a href="http://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2019/02/22/out-of-step-again/">column also published on Feb. 22</a>, where she wrote about the Supreme Court’s recent decision to the third extension of martial law in Mindanao. Olivares hit the NUPL for criticizing the SC in its decision to uphold the constitutionality of the extension of martial law.</p>
<p>NUPL represented the Makabayan bloc in the petition against martial law.</p>
<p>And recently, Laude accused NUPL as CPP front organization. “Aside from this ridiculous and baseless link, the shady group is inciting reprisal,” Olalia said.</p>
<p>“This series of attacks, bigoted and fantastic as they are, is not only disturbing but can be ominous of even worse things to come. It remains a challenge and clarion call though for human rights and public interest lawyers to stay the course and serve those who have less in life who have even lesser in law,” Olalia added.</p>
<p>Under President Duterte there were already 36 lawyers, judges and prosecutors who have been killed, said Olalia.</p>
<p>The most recent was the <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/11/07/rights-lawyer-gunned-down-in-negros/">killing of Ramos</a>, a human rights lawyer killed on Nov. 6, 2018 by two unidentified men in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. He was the secretary-general of NUPL-Negros Island chapter.</p>
<p>They were also not spared from trumped up charges for assisting their poor clients. Another NUPL lawyer <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/11/12/kathy-panguban-no-lazy-sundays-for-this-young-peoples-lawyer/">Kathy Panguban</a>, head of the NUPL Women and Children Committee was charged with kidnapping for assisting a mother in getting custody of her minor son in Sagay.</p>
<p>“Red-tagging may be viewed as a badge of honor for those who appreciate the value and role of being lawyers for the people. But in the real world out there, it is a stampmark that one can be fair game for vicious attacks from the intolerant, bigoted and despotic,” Olalia said. <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p><strong>By RAYMUND B. VILLANUEVA</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://kodao.org/">Kodao Productions</a> / <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/">Bulatlat</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA &#8212; Rotary International honored two National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) consultants — one recently killed, the other in jail— with peace awards in a ceremony at the Philippine International Convention Center Wednesday, February 27.</p>
<p>Felix Randy Malayao, brutally shot to death while asleep inside a bus in Nueva Vizcaya last January 30, and Rey Claro Casambre, arrested while on his way home by police and military agents last December 7, were given Ang Kapayapaan (Akap) Awards by the club’s International District 3830 based in Fort Bonifacio Global City.</p>
<p>The district’s Akap Awards is given to individuals and groups for their distinct contribution in advancing the cause of peace, the club said.</p>
<figure id="attachment_106712" style="width: 772px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rcc3.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-106712" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rcc3.png" alt="" width="772" height="450" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rcc3.png 772w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rcc3-626x365.png 626w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rcc3-768x448.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Rey Casambre’s daughter and sister receive the award in his behalf.

<p>“This is specifically intended to pay tribute to the advocates of the resolution of the homegrown armed conflict on our soil,” Rotary Club District 3830 president Raul M. Francia said in a letter to Malayao’s family.</p>
<p>The awards is one of Rotary International’s many ways to inspire others to be of greater service to humanity and give modest share to the arduous task of bringing about sustainable peace, he added.</p>
<p>As NDFP consultants, Malayao and Casambre were NDFP’s most active advocates, attending numerous peace forums in the Philippines and abroad.</p>
<p>Both attended formal peace negotiations in Europe since August 2016 as well as working group meetings in the Philippines.</p>
<p>The two awardees participated in the crafting of land reform and rural development as well as national industrialization and economic development agreements with the government peace panel.</p>
<p>In November 2017, Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP) President Rodrigo Duterte issued Proclamation No. 360 terminating peace negotiations with the NDFP.</p>
<figure id="attachment_106711" style="width: 778px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rfm1.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-106711" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rfm1.png" alt="" width="778" height="450" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rfm1.png 778w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rfm1-631x365.png 631w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rfm1-768x444.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 778px) 100vw, 778px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Relatives of Randy Malayao receive the award in his behalf. (Photo by Joseph Cuevas/Kodao)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In a bid to restart negotiations, the NDFP and GRP negotiating panels jointly crafted a stand down agreement in June 2018 as well as guidelines and procedures of an interim peace agreement and a draft amnesty proclamation for hundreds of political prisoners.</p>
<p>Duterte again cancelled the negotiations after, however, forcing most other NDFP peace consultants to take safety precautions, preventing them from carrying duties related to the peace negotiations.</p>
<p>NDFP consultants Adelberto Silva and Vicente Ladlad were arrested by government forces in October and November 2018 respectively.</p>
<p>Another consultant, Rafael Baylosis was arrested in January 2018 but was released earlier this year after the Quezon City Regional Trial Court dismissed charges of illegal possession of firearms and explosives against him.</p>
<p>Only Malayao and Casambre remained available for numerous speaking engagements mostly organized by church groups and schools until the latter’s arrest and the former’s assassination.</p>
<p>Last week, Duterte again hinted he is open to restarting the peace negotiations.</p>
<p>Rotary’s other Akap awardees included Government of the Republic of the Philippines chief negotiator Silvestre H. Bello III, resigned Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Jesus Dureza, Moro Islamic Liberation Front’s Mohagher Igbal and former Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines and Davao Archbishop Emeritus Fernando Capalla. <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>DAVAO CITY, Philippines – Human rights group Karapatan raised a red flag over the malicious flyers being distributed in Cagayan de Oro City red-tagging personalities, which they describe as a “military hitlist.”</p>
<p>The flyers tagged local church workers, lawyers, rights advocates and a journalist as “terrorist members of the New People’s Army and Communist Party of the Philippines.”</p>
<p>The group reported that the flyers were discovered by delegates attending the assembly and launching of Hustisya-Northern Mindanao on Friday morning at Philtown Hotel in Cagayan de Oro City.</p>
<p>A suspected military agent approached the security guard of the said hotel and handed him two brown envelopes with each contained 13 copies of the flyers, it added.</p>
<p>The flyer reads: “Ania ang listahan sa pipila ka miyembro sa Partido Komunista dinhi sa atong dakbayan nga nag tinguha nga magmadaugon sila sa ilang pag-ilog sa kagamhanan (Here’s the list of few members of the Communist Party of the Philippines in the city who aim to cease the power from the government).”</p>
<p>Included among the list are Iglesia Filipino Independiente Bishop Felixberto Calang, Fr. Rolando Abejo of Movement Against Tyranny-Northern Mindanao, Karapatan Northern Mindanao spokesperson Fr. Khen Apus, human rights lawyers Beverly Musni, Czarina Musni, and Beverly Ann Musni, and journalist Cong Corrales and his family.</p>
<p>“Such notorious lists have further endangered the already perilous situation of human rights defenders. We have repeatedly raised how these arbitrary and baseless accusations incite threats to the lives and security of named individuals, the worst of which is that they become victims of extrajudicial killings,” said Karapatan Secretary General Cristina Palabay in a statement.</p>
<p>Also written on the flyer is a warning that members of the CPP visit jails in the cities of Cagayan de Oro and Malaybalay in a National Solidarity Mission. It mentioned that Karapatan conducts meeting inside the United Church of Christ in the Philippines located at Licoan, Cagayan de Oro City.</p>
<p>The mission held on February 21 and 22, Palabay said, aimed to assist the families of victims of human rights violations in the region and to “look into the situation” of arrested progressive leaders Datu Jomorito Guaynon of IP group Kalumbay, KMP leader Ireneo Udarbe, and four members of the Misamis Oriental Farmers Association and that of evacuees from Lagonglong, Misamis Oriental.</p>

<p>Karapatan, IP and Moro group Sandugo, and peasant group Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas led the said mission and engaged with the Commission on Human Rights-Region 10 (CHR-10) to call for their release.</p>
<p>Palabay calls on the CHR and local government unit address the incident and “protect the rights defenders and make accountable those who continue to put their lives at risk.”</p>
<p>“Activists and everyone is being wrongly tagged as terrorists. The anti-terror law is being arbitrarily used against activists like Guaynon and Udarbe. This situation is made worse by the continuing implementation of martial law in Mindanao,” Palabay said.</p>
<p>A similar red-tagging incident also happened in Davao City last week where posters tagging progressive party lists like ACT Teachers, Anakpawis, Bayan Muna, Gabriela, and Kabataan as “protectors of the CPP-NPA-NDF terrorists.”</p>

Ariel Casilao as it endangers the lives of its members making them as “open targets to extra-judicial killings, threats, harassment, and prosecution.” (davaotoday.com) Reposted by <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>“The latest round of price hikes will definitely hurt consumers including low to middle-income earners and especially poor sectors like farmers, fisherfolk and urban poor.”</p>
<p><strong>By MARYA SALAMAT</strong><br />
<em><a href="http://bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA – Picket protests in different places across the Philippines greeted today’s hike in oil prices. On Feb 26, gasoline and diesel prices increased by Php1.45 per liter, kerosene by P1.35 per liter.</p>
<p>In three weeks of oil price hikes, the cumulative fuel price hikes as of this month is P6 for diesel, Php5 for gasoline and P4 to P5 per liter of kerosene.</p>
<p>Unlike the prices of other products, any hike in oil prices exerts a domino effect on prices of other products, said Bayan Muna candidate for Senator Neri Colmenares who led one of the picket protests in front of a Petron gas station in Timog Avenue, Quezon City.</p>
<p>During the protest, Colmenares chided the Department of Energy (DoE) for delaying the release of a circular that would order the unbundling of oil prices.</p>
<p><iframe width="768" height="432" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9pTx1duPf6A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>He said the rates of electricity and water have been unbundled as presented to the consumers, yet the price of oil remains a mystery to consumers.</p>
<p>“How can the Department of Energy do its job of ensuring that oil companies are not overcharging the consumers if it cannot even see the break-down or how the oil companies have been arriving at their prices of oil?” Colmenares asked.</p>
<p>He said unbundling is not the solution per se to the problem of oil price hikes and inflation – there is the oil deregulation law giving the oil companies freedom to increase prices; the TRAIN law that imposed an additional P2 as excise tax on every liter of oil products; and there are the other government policies that contribute to high prices of basic goods.</p>
<p>“It’s not true the government can’t do something to address the oil price hikes and its pressure on inflation,” Colmenares said.</p>
<p>To reduce the prices of oil products, Colmenares said, the government must suspend the excise tax imposed on oil products because of the implementation of the TRAIN (Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion) Law. He urged the Duterte government to remove also the Value Added Tax (VAT) imposed on oil products.</p>
<p>“With VAT on oil products, the government is benefiting from every spike in oil prices and adding to the misery of poor consumers,” Colmenares said.</p>
<p><strong>Higher inflation amid stagnant wages means greater misery</strong></p>
<p>Given the P4 to P6 per liter cumulative price hikes in the last three weeks, transport groups are now pushing for a P1-fare hike.<br />
The prices of basic goods, meanwhile, have already increased from 1 to 5 percent, canned goods by P0.40 to P1.30, some vegetable items by P10 to P40 per kilo, bangus by P40, beef by P25, and even condiments, Anakpawis Rep. Ariel Casilao said in another statement.</p>
<p>“The latest round of price hikes will definitely hurt consumers including low to middle-income earners and especially poor sectors like farmers, fisherfolk and urban poor,” the Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas said. Contrary to common estimates that mostly the drivers feel the pinch of oil price hikes, the agricultural sector also reels from it, according to KMP. Farmers use diesel in agricultural production and kerosene in their households.</p>
<p>Jovy Torres, a peasant woman leader and a mother of two, said farmers like her can no longer afford to pay for other needs after buying the most essentials. “We make do with just rice, salt and a little to eat it with. But even the price of salt has lately increased.”<br />
Torres earns only an average of P300 to P400 after selling her family’s farm produce like bananas and root crops. Other low-income sectors such as the fisherfolk and urban poor are expected to reel from the effects of price hikes.</p>
<p>At the Mendiola Peace Arch near Malacañang, youth groups burned during a protest rally some LPG-shaped effigies to dramatize the “stark condemnation and the resulting explosion of mass unrest.” They blamed the Duterte administration’s policies and called for Duterte&#8217;s ouster.</p>
<p><strong>Oil prices as election issue</strong></p>
<p>Considering that it is currently the campaign period for midterm elections, Senatorial candidate Neri Colmenares urged the public to scrutinize the candidates and quiz them for their position on oil deregulation, Value-Added taxes, TRAIN law and other policies that are contributing to the people’s poverty and misery.</p>
<p>&#8220;This should be a period of winning the people&#8217;s hearts and minds,” Anakpawis Rep. Casilao said. He criticized the administration candidates saying their loyalty to President Duterte, who is carrying out the very policies that sow poverty and misery across the country, will alienate them from the populace.</p>
<p>The women’s group Gabriela, meanwhile, blasted the Duterte government for using as excuse in implementing “tax reforms” the need to fund free college education, wage hike for teachers and government employees , pension, free medicines and other public services.</p>
<p>“The government shouldn’t run the interest and welfare of the people against its responsibility to provide for the rights of the majority,” said Joms Salvador, secretary general of women’s group Gabriela. She urged the public to take Duterte to task as “Duterte is saying all these while the legislators continue to relish their pork barrel and billions of public funds are being lost to corruption.”</p>
<p>To bring change or actual reforms that will benefit the people or even just give them a breather, Casilao of Anakpawis Partylist called for support for House Bill No. 7653 repealing the Train law, HB 3676 to regulate the oil sector, and HB 1760 to re-nationalize Petron. Lawmakers under the Makabayan bloc filed these bills.</p>
<p>To survive the shrinking household incomes, the progressive lawmakers also urged the Filipino workers and marginalized sectors to support the HB 7787 or the P750 National Minimum Wage and HB 556 Anti-Contractualization Bill.</p>
<p>Casilao appealed to the people “to stand against the fatal mixture of anti-people economics and traditional politics, which keeps the majority of Filipinos poor and miserable, and bars genuine national development.” <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>“The testimonies of the victims and their communities, as well as their steadfast commitment to fight for justice are enough bases to overcome the lies of this administration.”</p>
<p>MANILA – “Stop whining and address the issue,” Karapatan secretary general Cristina Palabay told the government after it once again tagged the group as front organization of the Communist Party of the Philippines, the New People’s Army and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines.</p>
<p>According to a report, the <a href="https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/02/24/1896303/npa-atrocities-cases-set-be-filed-un-body">Duterte government sent a delegation</a> to the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland to formally file a complaint against the alleged atrocities and human rights abuses committed by the NPA.</p>
<p>In the complaint, the government tagged the human rights group Karapatan, church group Rural Missionaries of the Philippines, think-tank Ibon Foundation, and the Mindanao Interfaith Service Foundation, Inc. as front organizations of the CPP-NPA-NDFP.</p>
<p>Palabay reminded the Duterte government that the “State is the primary duty-bearer in the promotion, protection and advancement of human rights.”</p>
<p>“You might have already forgotten [the government’s responsibility],” she added.</p>
<p>The United Nations is another arena where cases of human rights violations are filed by groups or individuals after it has exhausted all legal remedies available in the country. Karapatan, as well as other cause oriented groups, has <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/?s=united+nations&amp;submit">filed several complaints</a> of human rights violations committed by the State to the UN body including the killing of campus journalist Benjaline “Beng” Hernandez.</p>
<p><strong>Read: <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2010/10/07/philippine-government-told-to-enforce-un-rulings-on-rights-cases/">Philippine Government Told to Enforce UN Rulings on Rights Cases</a></strong></p>
<p>The government also formally moved for the <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2019/02/17/kin-insulted-by-govt-move-to-delist-enforced-disappearances-cases-from-un-records/">delisting of 625 cases of enforced disappearances</a> that took place from 1975 to 2012 with the UN Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearance (UN WGEID).</p>
<p>Palabay said such moves made by the government were a “desperate move to deodorize its notorious human rights record and to evade accountability for its crimes and tyrannical acts.”</p>
<p>“Together with other human rights and civil society organizations, and even international human rights experts and UN officials, we have been repeatedly maligned in the government’s vicious terrorist-labeling campaign and have faced reprisals due to our work exposing State-perpetrated human rights violations and demanding for justice and accountability,” said Palabay.</p>

<p>Palabay also added that the government has constantly rejected calls for independent investigations by human rights experts and “has barely responded substantially to communications sent by UN offices regarding cases of rights violations.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Through a national task force composed of militarists and mercenary hacks, it is promoting a most unbelievable lie &#8211; that government is correct and everyone else is wrong. What is however apparent is its elaborative effort to hide the injustices apparent in the country,” Palabay said.</p>
<p>Palabay also said that red tagging organizations, as well as journalists, who are exposing issues such as human rights violations committed by the state “will not erase the atrocious crimes already committed and are continuously being committed by state security forces.”</p>
<p>Karapatan and the Rural Missionaries of the Philippines including lawyers, bishops, priests and Mindanao-based journalists were also <a href="https://kodao.org/mindanao-journalist-condemns-red-tagging/">listed as front organizations of the CPP-NPA-NDFP</a>. The list was being circulated in Cagayan De Oro in Mindanao.</p>
<p>Palabay reiterated the dangers of being tagged as members of CPP-NPA-NDFP like being vulnerable to attacks such as “killing, criminalization of their work and beliefs and illegal detention, torture and other violations of the people’s right to uphold and defend rights, to form organizations and to conduct human rights work.”</p>
<p>She also criticized the “audacity of the Philippine government in shamelessly claiming efforts of civil society and human rights organizations, passing it off as their sincere effort to advance and protect human rights, while altogether dismissing the deteriorating rights situation and outrightly denying recognition of the victims.”</p>
<p>“The testimonies of the victims and their communities, as well as their steadfast commitment to fight for justice are enough bases to overcome the lies of this administration,” Palabay said. <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>Messages of solidarity came from Hongkong, Brussels, Vancouver, and Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>By JOMARI ALEJANDRO HERRERA III</strong><br />
<em>bulatlat.com</em></p>
<p>MANILA &#8212; Labor and rights groups around the globe called for the immediate release of Filipino trade union organizer and Kilusang Mayo Uno staff Maolen Maojo B. Maga this February, a year after his questionable arrest.</p>
<p>Messages of solidarity came from Hongkong, Brussels, Vancouver, and Chicago.</p>
<p>Maga’s wife and fellow activist Lengua de Guzman said international support for Maga has been there ever since, but the Free Maoj Maga Campaign gained international audience during the International People’s Tribunal held July last year.</p>
<p>De Guzman testified before the IPT regarding the trumped up charges against her father, peace consultant Rafael Baylosis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through Maoj&#8217;s case, the international community became aware of the plight of unionists in the Philippines. They found it very alarming,&#8221; De Guzman said in Filipino.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, groups recently stormed Camp Crame in Quezon City to condemn the continuing persecution of trade union and community organizers under President Rodrigo Duterte.</p>
<p>Maga was the first unionist arrested in 2018 after Duterte’s cancellation of the peace talks, quickly followed by a series of abduction and trump-up charges of other trade unionist and activists.</p>
<p>Among those who expressed their solidarity and support are fellow unionists from Hongkong, the Philippine Australia Union Link, the Viva Salud and ACV from Belgium, and from their network of friends and youth activists.</p>
<p>Maga, 39, was a member of the League of Filipino Students during his college days at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines.</p>
<p>He was a trade unionist for Kilusang Mayo Uno, where he organized workers in the port area, in factory belts in Valenzuela (among them were Kentex workers), and in Central Luzon.</p>
<p>On Feb. 22, 2018, Maga was abducted by police officers in plainclothes while playing basketball in their village in San Mateo Rizal. He was later surfaced in a police camp in Quezon City, facing trumped-up charges. <strong>(bulatlat.com)</strong></p>
