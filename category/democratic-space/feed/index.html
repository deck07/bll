<p><strong>By RENATO REYES JR.</strong></p>
<p>Lets’ take a brief review of the events and actions that shaped the year 2018. It was undoubtedly a year of fierce resistance, unity and unshakeable hope. We pay tribute to all those who made sacrifices in defense of our rights and freedoms. We celebrate the big and small victories in our never-ending fight for change. We note the huge challenges we face under a regime of tyrany. We stand firm knowing that the people remain our source of hope and strength.</p>
<p>Check out the year that was.</p>
<p><strong>Persistent efforts for charter change and dictatorship</strong></p>
<p>In January , the House leadership threatened to push with Cha-cha even without Senate and with very self-serving provisions via RBH 8. Various groups opposed Charter change and bogus federalism and formed the broad Stop Cha-cha Coalition in February. A rally was held on the anniversary of the EDSA People Power 1 on February 24.</p>
<p>Also in 2018, the Consultative Committee on Charter Change was formed and drafted its own proposal that was submitted to President Duterte. Various groups opposed the transition provisions of the draft charter which would give tremendous powers to the president. The cha-cha proposal would also open up the domestic economy to greater foreign control.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the year, the House of Representatives passed on third and final reading its own proposal, RBH 15, which sought charter change and the lifting of term limits and postponement of the 2019 polls. The version was so bad that even the members of the Consultative Committee rejected it. So far, the Senate is not keen on pursuing charter change at this time. It remains to be seen how both houses will clash on the issue in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Removal of the Chief Justice Sereno</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_102255" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CJ-SERENO.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-102255" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CJ-SERENO.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CJ-SERENO.jpg 1024w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CJ-SERENO-547x365.jpg 547w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CJ-SERENO-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CJ-SERENO-840x560.jpg 840w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/CJ-SERENO-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno. (Photo grabbed from Stand with CJ Facebook page.)</figcaption></figure>
<p>From impeachment to quo warranto, the Duterte regime pushed for the removal of Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno to ensure its control over all three branches of government. Various groups united to defend judicial independence vs the dictatorial maneuvers of regime. Protests were held in different parts of the country. Though removed from office, Chief Justice Sereno would emerge as an opposition leader taking on issues of justice, human rights and charter change.</p>
<p><strong>Fight against contractualization</strong></p>
<p>Some of the more prominent struggles in 2018 were the campaigns against contractualization. Thousands of PLDT workers won a case before the DOLE and demanded to be regularized , until the case was elevated to the Court of Appeals which reversed the decision.</p>
<p>The struggle of NutriAsia workers and the violent dispersal of the picket line gained public sympathy with calls for boycott of the condiments manufacturer reverberating among consumers. Scores were injured and some 19 workers and supporters, including media workers, were arrested during the violent attack on the picket line. The cases were eventually dismissed but the fight for regularization continues.</p>
<p><strong>Scuttling of peace talks (again)</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_96803" style="width: 1029px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/peace-talks-jonbustamante-1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-96803" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/peace-talks-jonbustamante-1.jpg" alt="" width="1029" height="686" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/peace-talks-jonbustamante-1.jpg 1029w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/peace-talks-jonbustamante-1-548x365.jpg 548w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/peace-talks-jonbustamante-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/peace-talks-jonbustamante-1-840x560.jpg 840w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/peace-talks-jonbustamante-1-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 1029px) 100vw, 1029px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">FILE PHOTO. Fourth formal peace talks in April 2017 at The Netherlands. (Photo by Jon Bustamante)</figcaption></figure>
<p>After a series of backchannel talks in June and the initialing of several agreements aimed at reviving the peace talks, the Duterte regime decided to call off the resumption of formal peace talks supposedly because it wanted to hold more “public consultations”. What really happened was the scuttling of the talks for the nth time, with the militarists again gaining the upperhand. Duterte’s termination of the talks saw government hype the so-called localized peace talks and fake surrenders. Most dangerous of all was the militarization of communities and reliance on the militarists within the administration. At least four peace consultants were arrested during the year; Raffy Baylosis, Adelberto Silva, Vicente Ladlad and Rey Casambre. All face trumped-up, non-bailable charges. The Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process is now headed by a retired general, former Chief of Staff Carlito Galvez.</p>
<p>There remains broad support among different institutions for the resumption of formal peace talks as it is a much more effective way and addressing the roots of the armed conflict than the all-out war being waged by the regime. The CPP will be observing its 50th anniversary on December 26 &#8211; a reminder that militarist approaches to the rebellion will ultimately fail.</p>
<p><strong>Stop TRAIN, oil price hikes, rising inflation, rice crisis</strong></p>
<p>The economic crisis was a major issue for 2018, with prices shooting up due to the TRAIN Law and other factors. A “rice crisis” was felt in many areas due to the shortage of cheap rice from the NFA. Oil prices shocked many consumers as soaring world prices were aggravated by the imposition of new taxes on oil products. The peso also ended up weaker this year, thus contributing to increased prices of imported goods. Protests for the scrapping of TRAIN marked the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Approval ratings of the president dipped as prices soared. With inflation peaking at 6.7%, the Duterte regime momentarily backtracked on the imposition of new oil taxes for 2019. However, with the recent decline in oil prices, the new oil taxes for 2019 are a go.</p>
<p>Broad unity, United People’s SONA in July &#8211;<em> Labanan ang Cha-cha, biguin ang diktadura</em></p>
<p>The United People’s SONA led the broadest protest against Duterte’s third State of the Nation Address. In a time when the reactionaries were divided, bickering and jostling for power inside Congress, thus delaying the SONA, the people were united outside Congress. The theme of the broad protest was L<em>abanan ang Cha-cha, biguin and diktadura.</em> In just two years, a broad united front against the Duterte regime had emerged &#8211; a sign of the worsening economic and political crisis brought about by the current administration.</p>
<p><strong>Trumped-up charges vs Makabayan 4 foiled</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_104331" style="width: 3264px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3095A582-299A-4612-93EC-2FCB2DDB6A0D.jpeg"><img class="size-full wp-image-104331" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3095A582-299A-4612-93EC-2FCB2DDB6A0D.jpeg" alt="" width="3264" height="2448" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3095A582-299A-4612-93EC-2FCB2DDB6A0D.jpeg 3264w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3095A582-299A-4612-93EC-2FCB2DDB6A0D-487x365.jpeg 487w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3095A582-299A-4612-93EC-2FCB2DDB6A0D-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/3095A582-299A-4612-93EC-2FCB2DDB6A0D-840x630.jpeg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 3264px) 100vw, 3264px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(BULATLAT FILE PHOTO) The Makabayan 4 with lawyers Rachel F. Pastores of Public Interest Law Center and Neri Colmenares of National Union of People’s Lawyers. (Photo by Anne Marxze D. Umil/ Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Many were surprised that a 12-year old case against Satur, Liza, Ka Paeng and Teddy would be revived by a Nueva Ecija judge, and a warrant issued against the four. The dire situation highlighted the continuing practice of filing trumped-up charges against critics of the regime. The trumped-up charges were later junked when the case was re-raffled to another judge who found no merit in the allegations against the Makabayan 4.</p>
<p><strong>Revocation of Trillanes amnesty, political crisis</strong></p>
<p>One of the most intense political crisis that affected the Duterte regime was its effort to render void the amnesty granted to Sen. Antonio Trillanes and the attempts to arrest the lawmaker even without a warrant, and solely on the basis of an Executive Order. The move showed the Duterte regime’s penchant for abusing the legal system to go after its critics. The arrest did not materialize when it was pointed out that no warrant existed. There were also reported grumblings within the military who did not like the revocation of the amnesty.</p>
<p><strong>Broad anti-fascist on September 21, Martial Law anniversary, International People’s Tribunal</strong></p>
<p>To mark the anniversary of Marcos’ Martial Law, various groups again came together for a broad action at Luneta. The Duterte regime was increasingly taking on the mantle of Marcos with the spate of extrajudicial killings, ascendancy of the military over civilian authority, the militarization of the countryside, Martial Law in Mindanao, and the persecution of critics. There were however several attempts to sabotage the rally through scare-tactics and disinformation. The people persevered however and protests were held throughout the country.</p>
<p>At about the same time, the International People’s Tribunal was convened and received testimonies regarding the dire human rights situation in the Philippines. The IPT rendered a guilty verdict against Duterte and the US government that supported the state forces committing the abuses.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Red October&#8217; psywar offensive, push back against fascism</strong></p>
<p>On the eve of the September 21 protests, the AFP proclaimed what it alleged as the “Red October” conspiracy of different anti-Duterte forces that would stage mass actions to supposedly oust Duterte on from September all the way to December. The psywar scheme made sweeping attacks on all forms of resistance, from workers protests, land occupation to anti-Martial Law film screenings and protests, labelling these as part of an elaborate conspiracy. Several universities were tagged as being NPA recruitment grounds for the “Red October” plot. The mass movement would soon push back and expose the sham conspiracy as nothing more than Red scare tactics and another attempt to muzzle legitimate dissent. Students, school administrators and artists were among those who led the push back against the AFP.</p>
<p><strong>Sagay massacre</strong></p>
<p>One of the worst human rights violations that happened in 2018 was the Sagay massacre in Negors. Farm workers had sought to till land in a hacienda so that they would have food after sugar season. While the farm workers and their families were resting in a makeshift camp, armed men opened fire on them killing 9. Instead of going after the perpetrators, the PNP, AFP laid the blame on the organization of sugar workers, the NFSW, and framed the incident as part of “Red October” even without a shred of evidence to back this claim. A broad range of groups and personalities condemned the Sagay massacre and called for an independent probe. The revolutionary forces in Negros pointed to private armed goods and paramilitary groups in the service of big landlords as the perpetrators of this most heinous crime.</p>
<p>Weeks after the Sagay massacre, Atty. Ben Ramos of the NUPL in Negros was shot dead near his home.</p>
<p><strong>Deportation of Sr. Pat Fox</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_105867" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sis-pat-by-loi.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-105867" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sis-pat-by-loi.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="636" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sis-pat-by-loi.jpg 960w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sis-pat-by-loi-551x365.jpg 551w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sis-pat-by-loi-768x509.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sis-pat-by-loi-840x557.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(BULATLAT FILE PHOTO) Sister Patricia Fox spent time with supporters hours before she leave for Australia. (Photo by Carlo Manalansan/ Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Beloved Australian missionary nun and friend of the poor Sr. Patricia Fox was forced to leave the country this year after several months of fighting a deportation order by the Bureau of Immigration. She was targeted by Duterte himself and accused of acts she never committed, in another case of political persecution of critics of the regime. Sr. Pat was an advocate of poor farmers and indigenous peoples. While she has left the country, the Filipino people remain grateful and look forward to seeing her again.</p>
<p>Earlier, Australian human rights lawyer Gil Boehringer was also deported after it was revealed that he was part of a Philippine blacklist of human rights defenders from different parts of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Attacks on Lumad schools, arrest of Satur, Rep. France and the NSM</strong></p>
<p>Under Martial Law in Mindanao, Lumad schools have been under attack by state forces and paramilitary groups. What was supposed to be a humanitarian mission to a Salugpungan school on November 28 turned in to a rescue mission of distressed Lumad students and teachers. However, those who carried out the rescue found themselves arrested, detained and slapped with ridiculous charges of child abuse and human trafficking. The incident put a spotlight on the plight of Lumad schools and communities under militarization and Martial Law.</p>
<p>The arrests of the NSM participants was one of the most recent cases of human rights violations under the Martial Law regime in Mindanao. There have been documented cases of extrajudicial killings, filing of trumped-up charges, as well as forced surrender of civilians labelled as NPA fighters. Martial Law would be extended by Congress for another year during a joint session last December 12.</p>
<p><strong>Fight against Imperialism, US intervention and China occupation</strong></p>
<p>The year 2018 saw continuing resistance against imperialist intervention. US imperialism wanted to retain its foothold in the country through military exercises, counter-insurgency involvement and military aid. While the people welcomed the return of the Balangiga Bells, the unequal US agreements violative of our national sovereignty remain.</p>
<p>On the other hand, various sectors have called out President Duterte for his stand on China and the West Philippine Sea. The Xi visit to the Philippines was marked by protests and criticism of bilateral agreements that will place the country in debt bondage to China. Questions were also raised on the agreement for joint development in the West Philippine Sea vis-a-vis the legal victory that the Philippines had already won in the international tribunal.</p>
<p><strong>Attacks on the church, media, human rights defenders</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_105379" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kathy-panguban.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-105379" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kathy-panguban.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="635" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kathy-panguban.jpg 960w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kathy-panguban-552x365.jpg 552w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kathy-panguban-768x508.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/kathy-panguban-840x556.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">NUPL lawyer Katherine Panguban during the indignation rally against the killing of Atty. Benjamin Ramos. The military filed kidnapping charges against Panguban. (Photo by Carlo Manalansan/Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The year 2018 will also be known as a year when attacks on various sectors critical of Duterte escalated. The Catholic church became a favorite whipping boy of the President after church leaders stepped up its criticism of the drug war. The media was also at the receiving end of attacks, with cases filed against online news outfit Rappler among some of the prominent cases.</p>
<p>Human right defenders meanwhile had to deal with increased harassment, Red-tagging, trumped-up charges, blacklisting and deportation, extrajudicial killings and other forms of attacks on human rights.</p>
<p><strong>Justice</strong></p>
<p>Impunity is not forever. This year saw the conviction of notorious human rights violator General Jovito Palparan. Also convicted in a separate case were the police officers who killed Kian delos Santos. Filipino journalists in the line of fire gained international recognition for their reporting in the Philippines. Filipino human rights defenders also performed their work with great distinction despite tremendous challenges. Political prisoners continue to challenge the trumped-up cases filed against them, with cases eventually dismissed and their freedom secured.</p>
<p>P.S.</p>
<p>I may not have listed down all the important events but feel free to add in the comments section what for you were important developments for the year.</p>
<p>Greater challenges and more intense struggles await in 2019. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nang isinasara na ang paaralan gamit ang kahoy, pako at martilyo, nakatutok ang mga armas sa sino mang lumapit. Banta ng Alamara sa mga guro at estudyante, “Kung hindi kayo aalis ngayong araw, may mangyayari.”</p>
<p>Ni <strong>PYA MACLIING MALAYAO*</strong></p>
<p>Nov 28 ng umaga nagsimula ang national solidarity mission (NSM) para sa mga komunidad ng Manobo sa Talaingod, Davao del Norte. Sila ay matatagpuan sa Pantaron Range, isa sa mga “last frontiers” ng Pilipinas na tinatarget pasukin ng higit 50 kompanya at mga proyektong mapaminsala. Excited akong makapasok sa Talaingod at makita sa wakas ang bahagi ng Pantaron Range, sagradong teritoryo na sinumpaan ng mga Lumad na depensahan hanggang sa huling patak ng kanilang dugo ilang dekada na ang nakalipas.</p>
<p>Inilunsad ang NSM dahil sa pagkampo ng 56th Infantry Battalion ng Philippine Army (IBPA) sa komunidad at sapilitang pagrekrut at pagpapakilos nila sa mga CAFGU (Citizens Armed Force Geographical Unit) at sa Alamara, isa sa mga binuong paramilitar ng 10th Infantry Division para sa diumano’y “counter-insurgency.” Layunin ng AFP sa operasyon nito na sapilitang isara ang mga paaralang Lumad, lalo na ang Salugpongan Ta ‘Tanu Igkanugon Community Learning Center, Inc, alinsunod sa order ni Duterte na “bombahin ang mga paaralan.”</p>
<p>Isang kagyat na layunin ng NSM na makapagdala ng pagkain para sa mga estudyante at guro na isang linggo nang nakakaranas ng food blockade.</p>
<p><strong>LGU, mga ahensya at koordinasyon</strong></p>

<p>Ilang linggo bago pa man kami dumating, nagpaabot na kami sa LGU. Makalipas ang limang pormal na sulat at hanggang sa matapos ang NSM, wala kaming nakuhang tugon at kongretong aksyon mula sa LGU para matugunan ang kawalan ng pagkain sa komunidad at itaguyod ang karapatan sa edukasyon ng mga Lumad.</p>
<p>Sa kabila ng kawalang aksyon, walang palya ang koordinasyon ng iba’t ibang ahensya para matiyak ang layunin ng 56th IBPA na gawing kriminal ang Salugpongan at iba pang mga progresibong organisasyon, at maipasara ang mga paaralang Lumad.</p>
<p>Para sa layuning ito, orkestrado ang pagpapabakwit sa mga guro at estudyante, ang pagpayag na sunduin ng aming mga van ang mga lumilikas mula sa Dulyan, ang mabilis na pagset-up ng checkpoint sa Sto.nino na dadaanan namin palabas, ang maagap na pagbalagbag ng mga truck ng 56th IBPA, at ang pagsulpot ng mahirap mahagilap na officer ng MSWDO (Municipal Social Welfare and Development Office) sa bagong checkpoint.</p>
<p>Ang mga aksyon ng militar at maging ng iba pang ahensya ng gobyerno ay alinsunod sa &#8220;kontrainsurhensiyang&#8221; patakarang tinaguriang Oplan Kapayapaan, Whole of Nation Initiative na may IP Centric approach, at ang bangis ng martial law sa Mindanao.</p>
<p><strong>Dahas</strong></p>
<p>Hindi bababa sa dalawang checkpoint ang inilagay ng 56th IBPA at paramilitar sa loob ng 10-kilometrong daan na papasok sa Sitio Dulyan, Brgy.Palma Gil, Talaingod.</p>
<p>Nasa Dulyan campus nagpunta ang mga lumikas na guro at estudyante mula sa Salugpongan school Sitio Nasilaban. Sa Dulyan ang sentrong paaralan ng Salugpongan. Bago nito, tatlong beses nang sinubukan ng Salugpongan staff na magpasok ng bigas at iba pang pagkain, ngunit hindi ito pinapayagan ng checkpoint. Sa mga panahong ito, nakapagpatawag din ng pagpupulong sa komunidad ang 56th IBPA na pinadaloy ng Alamara at CAFGU, mando nila ay ipasara na ng komunidad ang mga paaralan ng Salugpongan. Tinanong ng isang datu sa komunidad, “Kung isasara na ang mga iyan, paano ang libreng edukasyon para sa mga anak natin?” Nagulat ang lahat, pero arogante pa ring sumagot ang isang Alamara: “Datu, matigas na ang iyong ulo, pero hindi ang iyong leeg.” Nang isinasara na ang paaralan gamit ang kahoy, pako at martilyo, nakatutok ang mga armas sa sino mang lumapit. Banta ng Alamara sa mga guro at estudyante, “Kung hindi kayo aalis ngayong araw, may mangyayari,” at sa komunidad ang banta nito ay “kung di sila aalis ngayong araw, dadalhin kayong lahat sa batalyon.” Binugbog ang isa sa mga magulang na ayaw pumirma sa petisyon ng 56th IBPA at Alamara para isara ang Salugpongan.</p>
<p>Pinakamatagal na tatlong oras ng buhay ko: nakatanggap kami ng stress call mula sa mga guro sa Dulyan, kaya mabilis naming in-assess ang kalagayang pangseguridad at paano makakadugtong sa kanila. Sa Sitio Igang, Brgy. Palma Gil kami unang hinarang ng checkpoint. Ang unang negosasyon ay pahintulutan kaming pumasok para salubungin ang mga naglalakad na&#8217;ng mga guro, estudyante at staff. Tanging apat na sasakyan ang pinapasok, kasama ang ilang mga delegado. Wala pang 30 minuto ay nakabalik na sila, at kasama na namin ang mga lumikas mula sa Dulyan. </p>
<p>Akala ko ay tapos na ang gabing iyon, ngunit wala pang 20 minuto nang makalarga na kami ay tinamaan na ng malaking bato ang harap ng aming van. Basag ang windshield nito. Binato din pala sa may gilid na pinto ang isa pang van. Lalong bumilis ang patakbo ng aming sasakyan, may mga riding-in-tandem na sumusunod at nag-o-overtake sa aming convoy. Maya-maya pa ay biglang gumilid ang mga nasa likod namin na van. Tinamaan ng spikes ang kanilang mga gulong. Kailangang huminto ng convoy at magpalit ng mga gulong. Habang nag-aantay, ang van namin ang nasa unahan ng convoy. May dumaan na namang riding-in-tandem. Huminto sila limang metro sa unahan ng aming van, humugot ng baril at pinaputok ito ng dalawang beses, at saka humarurot paabante. Wala pang dalawang minuto ay bumalik ito at dinaanan muli ang aming convoy. Yumuko na ang lahat sa takot na targetin na ang mga tao sa loob ng mga van. Hindi pa man humuhupa ang tensyon, isang PNP checkpoint naman ang tumambad sa NSM convoy paglabas nito sa Brgy. Palma Gil at pagpasok sa Brgy. Sto.Nino. Isinalaysay agad ng nasa unahang van ang naranasan ng NSM ilang minuto lang ang nakalipas. Hindi naalarma ang mga pulis. Maya-maya pa ay nariyan na rin ang dalawang truck ng 56th IBPA na nakaharang sa unahan ng convoy. Dumating din agad ang pinunuo ng DSWD sa munisipyo ng Talaingod na mahirap mahagilap noong may araw pa. Mula sa pakikinig sa salaysay ng mga delegado ng NSM na nakaranas ng pandarahas matapos sunduin ang mga nagbakwit na estudyante at guro, nag-iba na ang tono ng PNP. Katuwang ang DSWD, akusasyon na ng mga ito na dinukot ang mga bata na kasama ng NSM. Wala sa kanilang pag-unawa ang kalagayang ipinasara ng 56th IBPA ang mga paaralan ng mga bata, at sapilitan silang pinaalis mula sa komunidad.</p>
<p>Sa tambalang PNP-AFP-DSWD, sapilitang dinala ang convoy sa Talaingod police station. Nag-file ng blotter ang NSM para maitala ang harassment na naranasan sa daan. Ang mga pangalan ng mga nagreklamo sa blotter naman ang ginamit ng pulis at DSWD para ihanda ang gawa-gawang kaso laban sa NSM at mga guro.</p>
<p>Sa estasyon, trinato na kriminal ang mga bata, guro at lider ng NSM. Ginising ang mga natutulog na bata sa mga van at sapilitang pinalabas. Sa gitna ng gabi, pinahanay sila sa harap ng van, tinutukan ng malakas na ilaw, piniktyuran, kinapkapan at saka pinapasok sa loob ng istasyon. Ikinulong ang 14 na mga bata sa taas ng istasyon, kasabay ng pagkulong sa 18 na mga guro at delegado ng NSM. Habang nasa “custody” ng DSWD ang mga bata, patuloy ang paghikayat ng PNP-AFP-DSWD sa mga bata na sabihing pagpapaputok ng baril ang itinuturo sa kanila ng mga paaralang Lumad.</p>
<p><strong>Mapait na pagtatagpo</strong></p>
<p>Ang mga isinarang paaralan sa Talaingod ay mga boarding school, at doon din nakatira ang ilang mga estudyante ng Community Technical College of Southeastern Mindanao, Inc. (CTCSM) para sa kanilang internship ng pagtuturo. Malayo ang komunidad at mga magulang ng mga bata, ang ilan sa mga magulang ay nauna nang nag-bakwit dahil sa pandarahas at pananakot ng mga militar sa ilalim ng martial law.</p>
<p>Mula sa Talaingod, inilipat sa Tagum City home for the aged ang dalawang batang lalake, at iba pa ay dinala sa DSWD center sa Davao City. Dtio, hinihikayat pa rin ng DSWD ang mga bata na umalis na sa Salugpongan schools, at lumipat na sa ibang mga paaralan.</p>
<p>Ilang linya ng komunikasyon ang ginawa ng mga natitirang guro at administrador ng paaralan para maabutan ang mga magulang ng mga batang kinulong. Matapos ang mahigit walong oras na byahe, ilang kilometrong paglalakad, isa-isa nang nakarating ang mga magulang papunta sa Davao City. Ilan sa mga magulang ay na-hold pa sa checkpoint ng halos apat na oras. Lahat sila ay kinakailangang iwan ang iba pa nilang mga anak para agad na puntahan at makuha ang mga ipiniit na bata. </p>
<p>Ilang buwan din ang lumipas nang huling magkita ang mga mag-anak. Sabik silang makita ang bawat isa lalo na dahil sa &#8216;di magandang karanasan noong mga nakalipas na araw. Nagtalunan, nagyakapan at naluha ang mga bata at magulang sa kanilang muling pagkikita. Tila sinibat ang kanilang mga dibdib nang sabihin ng DSWD na hindi maaaring umuwi ang mga bata dahil sa order ng nakatataas at mga prosesong pagdadaanan.</p>
<p>Hindi sila nakakulong sabi ng DSWD. Pero sa pakiramdam ng mga bata, at paningin ng mga magulang, walang duda na ikinulong ang mga bata dahil lang sa kanilang kagustuhan na makapag-aral nang libre at angkop sa kanilang kultura at kabuhayan. </p>

They have not been consulted about the Boracay closure. (Photo by Ina Silverio)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The deployment of over 600 police and 200 military personnel to Boracay to enforce President Rodrigo Duterte’s controversial closure and rehabilitation order of the island is a fascist overkill. Since when did bullets and bombs become cleaning agents for coliform, or conservation tools for flying foxes, sea turtles, and coral reefs?</p>
<p>Ironically, this is done under the pretext of “providing security and peace” and “making tourists feel safe.” In reality, we found out in a <a href="https://kodao.org/2018/04/25/no-plan-no-heart-in-boracay-closure-envi-group-says/">Fact Finding Solidarity Mission </a>held by our local affiliated organizations last April 18 to 20 that the police threatened residents that they will turn Boracay into a “new Marawi.”</p>
<p>What the island needs instead are environmental specialists who could actually study the concrete ecological situation and properly implement the rehabilitation of the island. The coliform outbreak, coral reef bleaching, and habitat loss of important flora and fauna cannot be driven away by riot drills and live-fire exercises.</p>
<p><em>Follow the updates,</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23NoToClosureYesToRehab">click #NoToClosureYesToRehab</a>. Watch also, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/altermidya/videos/1025157620967032/UzpfSTEwNDQzMDM3NTIyOTQ0Mjk6MTc3NjUxNDg0MjQwNjY0Ng/">&#8216;Yan ang Totoo sa Boracay Shutdown.&#8217;</a></p>
<p>The people have suffered enough already from the loss of their livelihood and neglect by the government to the tune of 36,000 lost jobs. Now they are faced with virtual ‘Martial Law’ with restriction of movement and even suppression of media coverage. Locals have been forced to flee the island by the hundreds.</p>
<blockquote><p>Why is Duterte not deploying these armed forces instead to the West Philippine Sea, Benham Rise, and other areas where our national patrimony and sovereignty are blatantly being undermined?</p></blockquote>
<p>Chinese poachers plunder our coral reefs with reckless abandon while their military forces have destroyed over 800 hectares of centuries-old coral reefs to build military bases on top of them. Chinese science vessels have already surveyed the maritime features of Benham Rise.</p>
<p>Why are Duterte’s bullets and bombs reserved instead for the likes of Boracay? Or in previous cases, for the schools of indigenous Lumad and just about any Filipino that Duterte’s coterie labels as ‘drug addicts’ or ‘terrorists’?</p>
<p>This “gunpowder mentality” even in environmental programs is not surprising but still appalling. Former military officials Roy Cimatu and Eduardo Año, both with track records of militarizing community resistance within natural resource hubs, are at the helm of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and Interior and Local Government, respectively.</p>
<p>The Duterte government should penalize erring establishments and declare a moratorium on new construction projects, including the mega-casinos. It should implement an environmental rehabilitation program informed by science and guided by democratic and humanitarian principles.</p>
<blockquote><p>A de facto Martial Law with no concrete and appropriate rehab plan is only a waste of taxpayers’ money and will only terrorize the local populace.</p></blockquote>
<p>Boracay needs scientists, engineers, development planners, social workers, and community organizers, not the hundreds of troops and police. This armed personnel must be pulled out of the island immediately. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Jerome Succor Aba, a Muslim human rights worker and peace advocate, experienced torture in the hands of US Homeland Security while he was detained for 28 hours at the San Francisco International Airport on April 17. He was invited by church groups in the US to speak about human rights situation in the Philippines. Below is Aba’s statement following his ordeal. </em></p>
<p><em>Asalaamu Alaykum.</em><br />
Peace be upon you.</p>
<p>I thank Allah SWT, the Almighty for giving me the strength and courage to survive the grueling 28 hours of torture. Alhamdullilah! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!</p>
<p>I send my deep gratitude for the untiring protest actions mounted by friends and organizations from all over the USA- from Portland to New York City. Your quick response to my situation, such as the rally at San Francisco Airport and call barrage, has helped tremendously in my release from the cruel clutches of the CBP and Homeland Security. I also send my highest regards to colleagues who rushed to my aid upon my return to Manila.</p>
<figure id="attachment_102903" style="width: 274px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jerome-aba-with-lawyer.jpg"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jerome-aba-with-lawyer-274x365.jpg" alt="" width="274" height="365" class="size-medium wp-image-102903" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jerome-aba-with-lawyer-274x365.jpg 274w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jerome-aba-with-lawyer-630x840.jpg 630w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jerome-aba-with-lawyer.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 274px) 100vw, 274px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Jerome Succor Aba with his legal counsel Atty. Kathy Panguban in the Department of Foreign Affairs on April 25. Aba submitted a letter to Foreign Affairs Secretary Allan Peter Cayetano to demand  impartial investigation on his torture and arbitrary detention under the US Department of Homeland Security. (Photo courtesy of Tinay Palabay)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I came to the US for a speaking tour on the human rights situation of our Moro brothers and sisters in the Philippines upon invitation by local US churches. The US Embassy in the Philippines granted me a 10-year multiple entry visa, certifying that my entry to the US is legal and sanctioned by the authorities.</p>
<p>Never did I imagine that this trip would end with my torture, detention and deportation.</p>
<p>I suffered heartless and dehumanizing abuses from interrogators of the Custom and Border Protection and the US Homeland Security. They detained me for 28 hours, hurled malicious accusations at me, deprived me of access to a lawyer and contact with family and friends.</p>
<p>The horror did not end there. They ordered me to strip naked with an industrial fan blasting at me. They deprived me of food for hours and later served me pork despite knowing that it is an affront to my religion. They threatened to kill me. Twice, they left me alone in a room with a gun and a grenade. They made me sign blank papers denying the torture happened.</p>
<p>I invoked my human rights many times but they refused to acknowledge them, saying, “You have no rights. You are not entitled to a lawyer. We are the law here.”</p>
<p>That twenty-eight-hour ordeal continues to send me chills even now in Manila. Just this morning, I woke up gasping for air as I was haunted by vivid images of my interrogators in my dreams.</p>
<p>I did not deserve that kind of treatment. No one does.</p>
<p>I believe my involvement in human rights work in the Philippines is the main reason I was deported. With Trump’s administration thriving in misinformation and falsehood, there is no place for me shedding light on the US’ hand in the destruction of Marawi and the ongoing “war on terror” against my Moro and Lumad brothers in Mindanao. This US “war on terror” led to the killings of civilians, forced evacuation due to aerial bombings in communities, and has reinforced Islamophobia.</p>
<p>This is the truth the US government wants to hide from the American people and the whole world.</p>
<p>This concealment and twisting of the truth is something we are familiar with as Filipinos. Here in our country, the human rights crisis is brashly dismissed by the government. Our own president attacks human rights defenders, shamelessly accusing them of supporting drug lords or labeling them as terrorists.</p>
<p>But the truth must and will be known. Duterte’s martial law in Mindanao resulted in the extra-judicial killings of 130 Moro, Lumad, and peasants. The military airstrike in the Islamic City of Marawi left 1,000 Maranao-Muslims dead while continuing airstrikes on the whole island have driven 500,000 Moros, Lumad and peasants out of their villages for safety. Ridiculous trumped-up charges have also been filed against 406 peasants and Lumad.</p>
<p>These brazen attacks against the people and their rights were executed to protect the interests of big US corporations. The Duterte government has opened vast lands of Mindanao, including the territories of the Bangsamoro and ancestral domains of the indigenous people, to exploitation and plunder by companies such as Dole, Unifruitti, and Del Monte.</p>
<p>Now, about a million hectare is encroached and operated by mining businesses and 500,000 hectares by plantations. On top of this, a million hectare is reserved for the expansion of oil palm plantations by 2020.</p>
<p>We will not sit on the sidelines and witness our people suffer from worsening environmental destruction, displacement, poverty, and grave human rights abuses. Neither will we be silenced when we are attacked and abused.</p>
<p>And so I say:</p>
<p>I am Jerome Succor Aba. I am a Muslim human rights worker from Mindanao, NOT a terrorist.</p>
<p>US BORDER OFFICIALS TORTURED ME. They violated my basic human rights recognized and protected by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p>
<p>I demand justice!<br />
Justice for Marawi Victims!<br />
End Martial Law in Mindanao!<br />
Stop U.S “War on Terror”!<br />
STOP ISLAMOPHOBIA!<br />
Muslim Not Terrorist!<br />
U.S IMPERIALIST, NO.1 TERRORIST!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Holy Week 2018  is a crucial opportunity for radical conversion. Jesus who has suffered so much for us, Filipinos, is inviting us participate in his crucifixion, death and resurrection so that without any fear and hesitation we participate in the transformation of the country.</p>
<p><strong>By FR. PETE MONTALLANA</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em> </p>
<p>While waiting for my turn to use a public toilet, a balot vendor friend  from the urban community where I live came over and complained to me that he was experiencing  chest pains radiating into  his whole body. That was the same symptom he felt seven years ago in Saudi  when he was hospitalized and a tube inserted into  his heart. According to the doctor that  tube could last  for ten years but my friend suspected  that he could have an attack anytime now because he has abused his body with only three hours of sleep  daily to be able to support his family. </p>
<p>He has not told  his wife about this to keep her from worrying but I insisted that he disclose  the matter with her because she would shoulder the burden if anything happened to him. Perhaps together they could discover some solution to his problem. This is indeed a difficult dilemma for my friend. As I watched him go  back to his house, I pleaded with  the Lord for his healing. </p>
<p>The reality that many of my neighbors endure regularly, the pain of poverty, has kept me focused on the mission of Jesus to bring the Good New to the poor. </p>
<p>Last January this year  Oxfam published that the world’s richest 1% get 82 % of the world’s  wealth. The  Philippines which is so much blessed with natural resources endure the same inequality.  Speaking to government officials in 2015 Pope Francis  was candid: “Break the bonds of injustice and oppression which give rise to glaring, and indeed scandalous, social inequalities”. </p>
<p>With Church leaders in the Manila Cathedral, he pleaded: “Only by becoming poor ourselves…, by stripping away our complacency, will we be able to identify with the least of our brothers and sisters. We will see things in a new light and thus respond with honesty and integrity to the challenge of proclaiming the radicalism of the Gospel in a society which has grown comfortable with social exclusion, polarization, and scandalous inequality.”<br />
At UST he talked about being evangelized by the poor. That was three years ago and have we internalized the Pope’s words? It is a resounding no! The situation of the poor has become worse. </p>
<p>We are now at the crossroads of our history when very important decisions have to made for our future, eg. Federalism, the Constitutions, China intrusions,  the Supreme Court issue and most especially the  Global warming issue which can bring about another much more devastating Yolanda because we refuse to read the signs. We seemed paralyzed by the developments.  </p>
<p>Holy Week 2018  is a crucial opportunity for radical conversion.  Jesus who has suffered so much for us, Filipinos, is inviting us participate in his crucifixion, death and resurrection so that without any fear and hesitation we participate in the transformation of the country.</p>
<p>Experiencing the Risen Lord we go beyond a faith that is confined to beautiful  liturgies and buildings and with a faith-response that  focus  simply  on doles-outs rather than understanding the  structural roots of poverty. 30 years ago we had the inspiration from II Plenary Council of the Philippines  to  establish the Church of the Poor by  empowering Basic Ecclesial Communities but that inspiration  generally remained well kept in the libraries.   </p>
<p>Perhaps we can start now  with the  Lenten practice to go on “visita Iglesia” (visiting churches). I suggest that we visit the poorer sections of the parish – not bringing dole-outs – but simply listening to the peoples’ stories and experiences – they are the living Church  being crucified. We can allow their pain to penetrate our hearts until mercy and compassion is evoked in us and we are led to examine our personal and communal  values and structures that have  imprisoned  the poor.   </p>
<p>For instance we  have taken advantage of the indigenous people and even now there is a move to totally deprive  them of the lands they owned long before our lowland ancestors came. </p>
<p>Realizing how  wayward we have been,  the merciful Father is just waiting to embrace back  his prodigal children this Holy Week  and replacing  our fears and   inadequacies with total commitment for the country.  </p>
<p>To everyone from the President down to the barangay personnel and  from the Cardinals to the lowly churchgoers    the Risen Lord will give to the humble  that special strength to walk the path of conversion and to take up the cross daily to transform our country.  </p>
<p>Concretely this would mean that believers can experience that  mysterious power to stand up and be heard unintimidated  by  name calling and fake news or even by the guns of state actors or by   non-state actors (that is, by the rebels). Like the believers during the Roman Empire who they were not afraid of persecutions, losing  jobs, property and even life, the empowered Filipinos will assert justice and truth.  They will face the courts from the lowest to the highest levels, whether national and international because “truth will set them free.”  Congress will  make laws no longer to consolidate their hold on power but to eradicate the structures that enslave the majority of the people to oppressive poverty since colonial times. Public servants are what they are  servants of the public who pay them with their taxes. </p>
<p>Perhaps the above might be utopic but the truth is that God is more powerful than the greed for power and wealth.   The crucifixion, death and resurrection of Jesus this 2018  together with people of good will can transform the 100 million Filipinos  to  bring life to the poor. It starts now with you and me.  <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

Since the Duterte Administration took over, their supposed mission was to eradicate drugs including other serious problems of the Philippines like poverty. In the article of Almi Atienza, Germelina Lacorte, Kate Pedroso and Rafael Antonio entitled ‘Traffic, poverty must also be Duterte’s priorities’ published by Inquirer Mindanao last October 6, 2016, they stated that the present administration should give attention not only to the war on drugs but also to the issue of poverty. Focusing on one specific problem is not really promoting an ‘ideal change&#8217;. They should give equal attention to the grievances of the people.</p>
<p>Regarding this topic, I can say that poverty is one of the roots of crime. In some cases, those people who are committing crimes like drugs do not have enough source of livelihood to raise their families. They are stuck between the two options: to live or to die.These people are finding alternative ways just to have money, so why shouldn&#8217;t we consider their concerns? These people need to be prioritized too.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let this small hole of poverty turn into a bigger one that will eventually swallow the whole country up. We better take action by solving the root of the problem. In doing so, its branches will eventually be solved as well.</p>

<strong>By KALIKASAN PEOPLE&#8217;S NETWORK FOR THE ENVIRONMENT</strong></p>
<p>We write with regard to the resurgence of debate on President Rodrigo Duterte’s ambivalence over the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, as it comes in a time when deeper public discourse and action on the climate crisis is urgently needed.</p>
<p>World leaders will gather at the United Nations ‘COP22’ climate talks once again to attempt to concretize the Paris Agreement’s agreed common actions on mitigating carbon emissions that induce climate change, adapting communities to worsening climate impacts, and ensuring financing, technology transfer, capacity building, and loss and damage mechanisms.</p>
<p>COP22’s commencement fittingly coincides with the Philippines’ commemoration of the third anniversary of Super Typhoon Yolanda (international name Haiyan). World leaders should be reminded that some 16 million people were severely affected by Yolanda’s powerful winds, floods and storm surges across the Philippines, and that these impacted communities are still struggling to recover three years later—a preview of what future climate norms are in store for us if climate disruption is left unfettered.</p>
<p>An alarming evidence of this was the findings of current Social Welfare Secretary Judy Taguiwalo that at least 200,000 Yolanda survivors have yet to receive emergency shelter assistance from the state because of discrimination by local politics during the Aquino administration.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the specter of ‘disaster capitalism’ continues to haunt Yolanda survivors. Initial findings of an environmental investigation mission held by the Center for Environmental Concerns and scientist group AGHAM regarding the proposed P7.9-billion Leyte Tide Embankment Project revealed how the biggest post-Yolanda mega-infrastructure solution actually threatens the livelihood and environment of some 10,000 residents across the east coast of Leyte.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is still a yawning gap between the abject plight of Yolanda survivors and other frontline communities and the reality of the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>The ‘flexible’ carbon mitigation mechanism of National Determined Contributions that makes contribution to emission cuts voluntary allows for the watering down of the historic and current responsibility of big polluter countries like the United States and China. Pressure is unjustly put on low carbon economies of developing countries when there should be none in the first place.</p>
<p>There are no concrete commitments and mechanisms that will ensure adequate and unconditional support for climate vulnerable countries. Even more marginalized was the proposed mechanism for ‘Loss and Damage’ that sought to facilitate compensation from industrialized nations to vulnerable nations that are already suffering climate impacts.</p>
<p>Transnational corporations and financial institutions, meanwhile, are given free rein to promote multi-billion dollar false climate solutions such as mega hydro, clean coal, and nuclear power plants, timber plantations, carbon credits, and other projects that displace communities and degrade the environment.</p>
<p>These are just the tip of the iceberg. It is hard not to cast a shadow of doubt over the Paris Agreement and the uphill battle to step up the pact’s ambition in the upcoming COP22. It is actually commendable how President Duterte asserts our people’s right to develop as the foundation of his argument, a right of vulnerable and poor nations that is given only tokenisms in the agreement.</p>
<p>The climate talks, however, are still a legitimate venue to advance the concrete needs and aspirations of our people. President Duterte can take a leaf from the book of Bolivian President Evo Morales, who called out global capitalism as the root of the climate and environmental crises in his plenary speech at COP21 last year, or from Pope Francis who also called for system change with his encyclical ‘Laudato Sii.’</p>
<p>At COP22, Duterte can take up the cudgels for the Filipino people struggling for climate justice, from the Lumad, Igorot, and other indigenous peoples resisting big coal and metallic mines to the Yolanda survivors that will march once again on ‘ground zero’ come November 8 to assert their demands for resilient homes and livelihoods.</p>
<p>These are the bigger battles outside the Paris Agreement that need to be fought, as these are the ones winning the struggle against the global system that perpetuates climate injustice. Let these stories of struggles in the frontlines be at the core of the climate talks.</p>

<p><strong>By THE INTERNATIONAL COALITION ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE PHILIPPINES</strong> </p>
<p>Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has drawn praise from US anti-war activists and peace advocates for his recent statement likening the violence in Mindanao to the crisis in the Middle East, and that in both cases, America has used the rhetoric of anti-terrorism and Islamophobia to intervene and create a crisis situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not that the Middle East is exporting terrorism in America. America imported terrorism,&#8221; Duterte stated last Friday to an audience of Muslim Filipinos during the Mindanao Hariraya Eid&#8217;l Fit&#8217;r 2016 in Davao City.  Duterte cited US invasion of Iraq and the toppling of Saddam Hussein as an example of war and destabilization, that along with intervention in Libya and Syria, has left the region in acute crisis. </p>
<p>“Thank you, President Duterte, for having the courage to tell the truth,” responded Chicago-based Joe Iosbaker of the <a href="https://www.unacpeace.org/" target="_blank">United National Anti-War Coalition (UNAC).</a></p>
<p>“It is indisputable the US government created Al Qaeda, created ISIS,” Iosbaker continued. Osama Bin Laden was trained by the CIA in Afghanistan. Al Qaeda in Syria was provided training and weapons by the U.S. to wage a war against the legitimate government in Damascus. Turkey, a U.S. puppet, has facilitated ISIS flow of weapons and recruits in Syria. Saudi Arabia, a U.S. puppet, armed Al Qaeda in Iraq, and they armed Al Qaeda and ISIS in Syria.  If the U.S. did not want Al Qaeda and ISIS to get this support, they could have ordered their puppets to stop. The order never came.”</p>
<p>In 2002, the Bush administration declared the Philippines, in particular Mindanao, the so-called “Second Front” to the Global War on Terror, claiming groups such as the Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiah have links to Al Qaeda and ISIS. In Mindanao, a Muslim minority, the Bangsamoro, are continuing to fight an armed struggle for self-determination and in defense of their mineral and oil-rich territory from corporate extraction. </p>
<p>According to the Philippine Statistics Authority, 11 out of the 20 poorest provinces in the Philippines are located in Mindanao, with the highest poverty incidence in the Bangsamoro territories</p>
<p><a href="http://www.humanrightsphilippines.net/events/international-conference-for-peoples-rights-in-the-philippines/" target="_blank">Iosbaker will be traveling to Mindanao this July 16-24</a> as part of a 100+ US delegation to events sponsored by the International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines, or ICHRP, including a fact-finding mission in Zamboanga, where the US stationed its special forces for 13 years as part of the Global War on Terror.</p>
<p>“The US invasion of the Middle East and continuing military presence there is about US control over the world’s largest oil deposits and other minerals. It’s the same in Mindanao, home to over $1 trillion worth of untapped natural minerals and oil, making the Philippines the 5th most mineral-region in the world,” Iosbaker continued.</p>
<p>“Just like the Filipino people, the American people want peace and genuine development in the Philippines. Right now, at the root of the socio-economic crisis and unrest in the country is impoverishment resulting from US economic policies and militarism, funded by US tax dollars. I applaud Duterte’s push to resume formal peace talks with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines, which seeks to address the roots of the armed conflict in the country. Americans don’t want our tax dollars funding crisis and bloodshed in the Philippines.&#8221; <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat " src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p><strong>By Prof. JOSE MARIA SISON</strong><br />
Founding Chairman, Communist Party of the Philippines</p>
<p>Dear comrades, friends and compatriot, </p>
<p>First of all, I thank the organizers and all of you for coming. I am overwhelmed and humbled by this celebration. I came to this event, thinking that I would sit back and enjoy myself most of the time. But Julie has made a proposal to further activate me in connection with the revitalization and expansion of the work of the Center for Social Studies. I am thus reminded that there is no sitting back and no retirement for revolutionaries.<br />

I am happy that <em>Building Strength Through Struggle</em>, the third book in the series of five books titled <em>Continuing the Philippine Revolution</em>, is now being launched in The Netherlands in conjunction with the celebration of my 55 years of service to the revolutionary cause of the Filipino people as well as my 75 years of existence outside of the womb.</p>
<p>This book extends, reinforces and further develops the principles, policies and major lines of action for carrying out the people&#8217;s democratic revolution, as put forward by the earlier two books in the series, <em>Foundation for Resuming the Philippine Revolution</em> and <em>Defeating Revisionism, Reformism and Opportunism</em>. It includes the major documents of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) which I drafted, and the major articles that I wrote under the nom de guerre Amado Guerrero, from the formal declaration of martial law on 21 September 1972 to my capture on 10 November 1977.</p>
<p>The book is indispensable to understanding why and how, under the leadership of the CPP, the Filipino people and their revolutionary forces successfully fought and defeated the US-instigated fascist dictatorship of Marcos. The dictatorship was designed to destroy the revolutionary movement but instead served to incite the people to rise up further against the semi-colonial and semi-feudal ruling system.</p>
<p>Let me cite the major contents of the books to show how the CPP guided the revolution.</p>
<p>When Marcos imposed fascist dictatorship on the people and outlawed all types of legal opposition, the CPP was already ideologically, politically and organizationally prepared to lead the people in the revolutionary struggle for national liberation and democracy. Soon after the declaration of martial law, the Party issued the comprehensive statement, <em>Overthrow the US-Marcos Dictatorship to Achieve National Freedom and Democracy</em>. It condemned the dictatorship as an ultra-reactionary instrument of US imperialism and the local exploiting classes, and called for its overthrow through the people&#8217;s war. It described the fundamental and fatal weaknesses of the fascist state and the conditions for its eventual downfall, notwithstanding its appearance of overwhelming power and invincibility.</p>
<p>Basing itself on the nationwide spread of the Party, the New People&#8217;s Army, the underground mass organizations, and the local organs of political power, the Party issued the <em>Guide for Establishing the People&#8217;s Democratic Government</em> to lay down the principles, policies and methods for building the revolutionary government in the countryside, in order to replace the counterrevolutionary state of the big compradors and landlords based in the urban areas. It was in the period of 1972 to 1977 that the revolutionary forces struck deep roots among the people, especially among the toiling masses, on a national scale.</p>
<p>The Party issued <em>Specific Characteristics of our People&#8217;s War in the Philippines</em> on the basis of the rich experience already accumulated by the New People&#8217;s Army from 1969 to 1975. This historic document creatively applies Chairman Mao Zedong’s principles, strategy and tactics of people’s war to concrete Philippine conditions, by taking into account the relatively wide countryside, and the archipelagic and mountainous character of the country, as well as the domestic and international situation. The comprehensive and profound formulation of the strategy and tactics has guided the New People&#8217;s Army and the revolutionary movement in growing in number and all-round strength, and frustrating the enemy campaigns to destroy the armed revolution.</p>
<p>The Party issued <em>Our Urgent Tasks</em> to sharpen the general political line as one of combating fascism, feudalism and imperialism, and called on the revolutionary forces to carry out the urgent tasks and the proper methods and steps in building the local organs of political power and the mass organizations of various types, and in waging the mass campaigns for land reform and other social purposes. Since then, the mass base of the armed revolution has been growing wave upon wave.</p>
<p>The requisite of mass work has ensured the mass base for carrying out a protracted people&#8217;s war.</p>
<p>The <em>10-Point Program of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines</em> was first outlined in 1973. It was eventually elaborated upon in 1977, spelling out in major detail the method for overthrowing the Marcos autocracy. It shows how the national and democratic rights and interests of the toiling masses of workers and peasants and the urban petty bourgeoisie can be realized and harmonized, and how the united front of the basic revolutionary forces must be built. The NDFP has been consolidated thereby as a united front of the basic<br />
revolutionary forces, serving as a reliable base for engaging in broader alliances in order to isolate and destroy the enemy at every given time.</p>
<p>The decisions taken by the CPP Central Committee were resolutely and militantly implemented by the Party rank and file, the New People&#8217;s Army and the masses. The ground for fighting and defeating the Marcos fascist dictatorship was well laid on a national scale from 1972 to 1977. Thus, even after I was captured by the enemy on 10 November 1977, I continued to be confident that the Filipino people and their revolutionary cause would prevail over the enemy.</p>
<p>It is necessary to read and study all the contents of <em>Building Strength Through Struggle </em>in order to understand why and how the people&#8217;s democratic revolution had led to the overthrow of the Marcos fascist dictatorship, how it has continued to fight and win victories against the pseudo-democratic regimes, how it has frustrated subjectivist and opportunist trends, and how it has excelled as a torch bearer of armed revolution led by the proletariat amidst the dominance of neocolonialism in the underdeveloped countries, the full<br />
restoration of capitalism in former revisionist-ruled countries, and the neoliberal plunder and aggression of the imperialist powers worldwide.</p>
<p>The CPP, NPA, NDFP and the people&#8217;s democratic revolution in the Philippines enjoy the respect, appreciation, and support of the world anti-imperialist movement and the international communist movement. This book, <em>Building Strength Through Struggle</em>, illumines the path to understanding the fact. Thank you. </p>
