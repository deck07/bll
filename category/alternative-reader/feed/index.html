<p>The aggravating plunder and destruction of the mountains are fanning the flames of people&#8217;s protest.</p>
<p><strong>By DENNIS ESPADA</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>ANTIPOLO CITY – Covering a vast land surface from Cagayan in the north to Laguna-Quezon in the south, the Sierra Madre is the country&#8217;s longest mountain range. Its teeming rivers, falls, springs and other resources not only provide sustenance to people living in the uphill, slopes and borders but also benefit the urban population as well.</p>
<p>As one of the world&#8217;s biodiversity centers, its 1.4 million hectares (or 40 percent of the country&#8217;s total forest cover) is home to a great number of endemic species, including our national treasure, the endangered &#8220;Haring Ibon&#8221; (king of birds) or Philippine Eagle.</p>
<p>Ecological groups believe the mountains, despite its fragile state, shield Luzon Island from devastating typhoons originating from the Pacific Ocean. The impacts of flood-causing heavy rains triggered by typhoon Ondoy in 2009 have turned the importance of preserving its remaining forests into a matter of public concern.</p>
<p>Though President Benigno Aquino III has proclaimed September 26 as &#8220;Save Sierra Madre Day&#8221;, his administration hypocritically allows the further destruction of the mountain range by big foreign and local corporations through its Private-Public Partnership (PPP) program. This is according to affected communities and concerned sectors that assembled on the same date this year to form an alliance, aptly called Protect Sierra Madre.</p>
<p><strong>Threatened biodiversity, resources</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;The mountains serve as a natural pharmacy, food source, and sacred ancestral ground for our indigenous folk,&#8221; the green group Kalikasan-People&#8217;s Network for the Environment (KPNE) said in its solidarity message. &#8220;High mountains also hold hidden mineral reserves, which, if the people would develop based solely on their needs, could serve as a platform for our genuine development and industrialization.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group revealed that the Sierra Madre has three national parks and 10 protected areas, two of which are found in the Southern Tagalog region—the Quezon Protected Landscape and the Upper Marikina Basin Protected Landscape. These protected areas cover more than 27,000 hectares of land and forests.</p>
<p>Our country relies on the mountains for renewable energy, but &#8220;neoliberal&#8221; policies under past and present regimes have turned over the control and utilization of these resources into the hands of profit-oriented businesses.</p>
<p>These include: Metro Manila Waterworks and Sewerage Systems&#8217; New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam project in Tanay, Rizal; Sierra Madre Water Corporation&#8217;s 35-million watt multi-river hydropower cum bulk water project in Pakil, Pangil and Paete in Laguna, and Real in Quezon; and Green Circle Properties&#8217; Pacific Coast Cities project in General Nakar in Quezon and Dingalan in Aurora, among others.</p>
<p>Will the people benefit from the construction and operation of these dams and other &#8220;development&#8221; projects?</p>
<p>Dr. Giovanni Tapang, a physicist and national president of AGHAM (Advocates of Science and Technology for the People), said these PPP-initiated projects would do good only for big business, foreign investors and President Aquino himself.</p>
<p>In a forum attended by Dumagat-Remontado folk, students, church people and environmental advocates, he explained how large dams, if damaged or not properly built, could cause flooding in downstream communities.</p>
<p>Dams also involve submerging of rich biodiversity sites, including species with medicinal properties waiting to be discovered. Dr. Tapang said that once it is gone, we would not be able to restore it. &#8220;The Sierra Madre came into being after millions of years, along with all the species of flora and fauna that evolved with it&#8230;If these are destroyed, it&#8217;s like the whole world has suffered a huge loss,&#8221; he warned.</p>
<p>The physicist pointed out that affected indigenous people&#8217;s right to their ancestral domain and self-determination should be the basis for any development plan or initiative.</p>
<p>The KPNE, in addition, explained the concept of national patrimony: &#8220;The country&#8217;s natural wealth should primarily serve the interests of its citizens, to have a sustainable agriculture, to conserve nature and build industries that would create more jobs and develop our lives.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Suffering of Stewards</strong></p>
<p>Since 2003, the United Nations&#8217; (UN) General Assembly has recognized the key role of indigenous people, settlers and poor peasants as stewards of the mountains, especially in maintaining ecosystems and providing environmental services.</p>
<p>According to Kakay Tolentino of Katribu Partylist, what endangers them from taking responsibility or fulfilling such role, apart from worsening hunger and landlessness, are the continuing ethnocide, forced evacuations and harassments by military and paramilitary elements.</p>
<p>The brutal massacre of school head Emerito Samarca as well as Lumad leaders Dionel Campos and Bello Sinzo in Lianga, Surigao del Sur last September 1, she said, has aroused public outrage on the Aquino government&#8217;s counter-insurgency campaign that victimizes innocent and unarmed civilians.</p>
<p>UN special rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Victoria Tauli-Corpuz disclosed that 100 indigenous people were already killed while defending their lands and environment over the past three years alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not turning our backs on development but the government should consider our own development as well,&#8221; Dumagat-Remontado leader Arnel delos Santos said. &#8220;We just want to live peacefully in the rural areas, but why are they demolishing our homes?&#8221;</p>
<p>He denounced the &#8220;inutility of the National Commission for Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) and its obvious collusion with big local and foreign corporations to deceive and divide the indigenous people. And despite the brutal killing of his father, anti-dam activist Nicanor &#8220;Kano&#8221; delos Santos, in December 2001, he told supporters that their unity remain strong even under difficult situations.</p>
<p>&#8220;For as long as dam proponents repeatedly and seriously push through with the project, we will also repeatedly and seriously stand our ground to oppose it. We&#8217;re not afraid of their attempts to suppress us since our goal is for the welfare of our fellow Dumagat-Remontado folk,&#8221; he said. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<em>Posted by Bulatlat </em></p>
<p>US Army Specialist Victor Agosto served a 13-month deployment in Iraq with the 57th Expeditionary Signal Battalion. &#8220;What I did there, I know I contributed to death and human suffering,&#8221; Agosto told Truthout from Fort Hood, in Killeen, Texas, in May, &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to quantify how much I caused, but I know I contributed to it.&#8221; </p>
<p>His experience in Iraq, coupled with educating himself about US foreign policy and international law, has led Agosto to refuse to deploy to Afghanistan. &#8220;It&#8217;s a matter of what I&#8217;m willing to live with,&#8221; he said of his recent decision, &#8220;I&#8217;m not willing to participate in this occupation, knowing it is completely wrong.&#8221; </p>
<p>Agosto&#8217;s lawyer, James Branum, who is also the legal adviser to the GI Rights Hotline and co-chair of the Military Law Task Fore, told Truthout during a phone interview on July 10 that, contrary to mainstream opinion that believes Afghanistan to be a &#8220;justified&#8221; war, the invasion and ongoing occupation are actually in violation of the US Constitution and international law. </p>
<p>&#8220;Victor is approaching this from the standpoint of law and ethics,&#8221; Branum explained, &#8220;It&#8217;s his own personal ethics and principles of the Nuremburg Principles, that the war in Afghanistan does not meet the criteria for lawful war under the UN Charter, which says that member nations who joined the UN, as did the US, should give up war forever, aside from two exceptions: that the war is in self-defense, and that the use of force was authorized by the UN Security Council. The nation of Afghanistan did not attack the United States. The Taliban may have, but the nation and people of Afghanistan did not. And under US Law, the Supremacy Clause of the US Constitution, any treaty enacted by the US is now the &#8220;supreme law of the land.&#8221; So when the United States signed the UN Charter, we made that our law as well.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Supremacy Clause is a clause in the United States Constitution, Article VI, Paragraph 2. The clause establishes the Constitution, Federal Statutes, and US treaties as &#8220;the supreme law of the land.&#8221; The text establishes these as the highest form of law in the American legal system, mandating that state judges uphold them, even if state laws or constitutions conflict. </p>
<p>This was also the basis for the stand taken by Lt. Ehren Watada of the US Army, who in 2006 was the first commissioned officer to publicly refuse a combat deployment to Iraq. </p>
<p>In an article for Truthout published August 14, 2006, I posted the text of a speech given by Watada at a National Convention of Veterans for Peace in Seattle, Washington, where I was present. </p>
<p>Watada outlined the principled stand he took, which applies to that of Victor Agosto today: </p>
<p>&#8220;The oath we take swears allegiance not to one man but to a document of principles and laws designed to protect the people. Enlisting in the military does not relinquish one&#8217;s right to seek the truth &#8211; neither does it excuse one from rational thought nor the ability to distinguish between right and wrong. &#8220;I was only following orders&#8221; is never an excuse. </p>
<p>&#8220;The Nuremburg Trials showed America and the World that citizenry as well as soldiers have the unrelinquishable obligation to refuse complicity in war crimes perpetrated by their government. Widespread torture and inhumane treatment of detainees is a war crime. A war of aggression born through an unofficial policy of prevention is a crime against the peace. An occupation violating the very essence of international humanitarian law and sovereignty is a crime against humanity. These crimes are funded by our tax dollars. Should citizens choose to remain silent through self-imposed ignorance or choice, it makes them as culpable as the Soldier in these crimes. </p>
<p>&#8220;Aside from the reality of indentured servitude, the American Soldier in theory is much nobler. Soldier or officer &#8211; when we swear our oath &#8211; it is first and foremost to the Constitution and its protectorate, the people. If soldiers realized this war is contrary to what the Constitution extols &#8211; if they stood up and threw their weapons down &#8211; no president could ever initiate a war of choice again. When we say, &#8220;&#8230; Against all enemies foreign and domestic&#8221; &#8211; what if elected leaders became the enemy? Whose orders do we follow? The answer is the conscience that lies in each soldier, each American, and each human being. Our duty to the Constitution is an obligation, not a choice.&#8221; </p>
<p>In a victory for Lieutenant Watada, the Justice Department decided in May to drop any further attempts to retry the officer for his refusal to deploy to Iraq. </p>
<p>Having served three years and nine months in the US Army, Agosto was to complete his contract and be discharged on August 3, but due to his excellent record of service and accrued leave, he was to be released at the end of June. Nevertheless, due to the stop-loss program (a program used to keep soldiers enlisted beyond the terms of their contracts which has affected over 185,000 soldiers since September 11, 2001) the Army decided to deploy him to Afghanistan anyway. </p>
<p>When Agosto refused, the Army issued him a Counseling Statement (a punitive US Army memo) on May 1, which outlined actions taken by the Army to discipline Agosto for his refusal to obey a direct order from his company commander, Michael J. Pederson. Agosto wrote on the form, &#8220;There is no way I will deploy to Afghanistan. The occupation is immoral and unjust. It does not make the American people any safer. It has the opposite effect,&#8221; and posted it on his FaceBook page. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>China unveiled the locally built Jian-10 last week, saying it narrows the gap with advanced nations.</p>
<p>By Peter Ford<br />
<em>The Christian Science Monitor</em></strong></p>
<p>BEIJING – A sleek, swept-wing fighter-bomber dubbed the &#8220;Jian-10,&#8221; unveiled here last week, is more than just another jet plane. It is China&#8217;s calling card, announcing Beijing&#8217;s arrival among the top ranks of military manufacturers.</p>
<p>Powered by Chinese engines and firing Chinese precision-guided missiles, the locally built Jian-10 has &#8220;allowed China to become the fourth country in the world&#8221; to have developed such a capability, &#8220;narrowing the gap with advanced nations,&#8221; boasted Geng Ruguang, deputy general manager of the plane&#8217;s manufacturer, Avic-I. </p>
<p>The latest fruit of a military modernization drive that has produced an indigenous Chinese nuclear attack submarine, early warning aircraft, frigates and destroyers, cruise missiles, and computerized command and control systems, the Jian-10 is &#8220;a decisive step by China toward becoming an aviation power,&#8221; the official Xinhua news agency declared.</p>
<p>The plane is also a new symbol of China&#8217;s role-reversal in the global arms industry. &#8220;Most technology analysts have been surprised by the speed with which China has gone from being an arms-buying country to one with real promise of being a producer of front-edge military technology,&#8221; says Denny Roy, senior researcher at the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies in Honolulu.</p>
<p><strong>Neighbors wary of China&#8217;s military advances</strong></p>
<p>To some of China&#8217;s neighbors, though, that promise looks more like a threat. And Pentagon officials, too, have repeatedly urged Beijing to explain more clearly the purpose behind a military buildup that has seen defense spending rise by more than 10 percent a year since 1990, according to official Chinese figures.</p>
<p>Offering rare insights into the Chinese leadership&#8217;s strategic view of the world, the government issued a defense white paper at the end of last year, in a bid to clarify its military policies.</p>
<p>The paper declares that &#8220;China&#8217;s overall security environment remains sound,&#8221; but notes &#8220;challenges that must not be neglected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chief among them, it says, is &#8220;the struggle to oppose and contain the separatist forces for &#8216;Taiwan independence,&#8217; &#8221; which &#8220;remains a hard one.&#8221; Beijing claims the island of Taiwan as its own &#8211; a position rejected by the government in Taipei.</p>
<p>The white paper, the first of its kind in two years, sets ambitious military goals for the People&#8217;s Liberation Army (PLA), harping repeatedly on the need for technological modernization. By the middle of this century, China should be &#8220;capable of winning informationized wars,&#8221; it says, referring to the computerized battlefield on which future wars will be fought.</p>
<p>Such capabilities, China insists, are &#8220;purely defensive in nature,&#8221; and the report does not repeat the threat contained in the last white paper to crush any serious move toward Taiwanese independence &#8220;resolutely and thoroughly.&#8221;</p>
<p>It does, however, note disapprovingly of heightened US-Japanese military cooperation, as Tokyo and Washington build a joint missile shield designed to protect Japan from North Korean missiles. Beijing appears to worry that Taiwan may one day be brought under this shield, blunting the mainland&#8217;s military strength in any cross-Strait conflict.</p>
<p>The white paper came on the heels of a speech by President Hu Jintao calling for a stronger &#8220;blue water&#8221; navy with the ability to range far from home ports. &#8220;We should strive to build a powerful navy that adapts to the needs of our military&#8217;s historical mission in this new century,&#8221; Mr. Hu said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We should make sound preparations for military struggles and ensure the forces can effectively carry out missions at any time,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>What such missions might be was hinted at in the white paper, which mentions &#8220;ensur[ing] the interests of national development&#8221; as a key element of China&#8217;s defense policy, and refers to security issues including &#8220;energy, resources, finance, information, and international shipping routes.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Buildup needed to protect trade, China says</strong></p>
<p>A Pentagon report last year detected Chinese ambitions to build a fleet capable of protecting the sea lanes that carry the country&#8217;s vital oil imports through the Straits of Malacca, and of operating even farther afield, in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s growing political and economic interests, especially its worldwide appetite for imported raw materials, mean that it sees defending those interests in ever broader terms, says Dr. Roy.</p>
<p>&#8220;As such a big country, with an ever more global outlook, what China needs to do to defend its national interests will inevitably impinge on the interests of other countries,&#8221; Roy predicts, and &#8220;it will demand a degree of diplomatic skill&#8221; to assuage neighbors&#8217; suspicions of Chinese intentions, he adds.</p>
<p>Many Western analysts accept Chinese officials&#8217; argument that military spending has increased only in line with their country&#8217;s economic rise. Officially, spending is set at $36.4 billion this year, but it is generally believed to be about twice that.</p>
<p>But while &#8220;their focus is defensive, any weapon can be used offensively,&#8221; points out Robert Karniol, Asia-Pacific bureau chief for Jane&#8217;s Defence Weekly.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Poland is just the latest fall guy for an American foreign policy dictated by military industrial lobbyists in Washington</p>
<p>BY GEORGE MONBIOT<br />
The Guardian<br />
ALTERNATIVE READER<br />
Posted by <em> <a href="http://www.bulatlat.com/" style="font-weight: bold"> Bulatlat.com</a></em><br />
Vol. VIII, No. 29, August 24-30, 2008</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a novel way to take your own life. Just as Russia demonstrates what happens to former minions that annoy it, Poland agrees to host a US missile defence base. The Russians, as Poland expected, respond to this proposal by offering to turn the country into a parking lot. This proves that the missile defence system is necessary after all: it will stop the missiles Russia will now aim at Poland, the Czech Republic and the UK in response to, their involvement in the missile defence system.</p>
<p>The American government insists that the interceptors, which will be stationed on the Baltic coast, have nothing to do with Russia: their purpose is to defend Europe and the US against the intercontinental ballistic missiles Iran and North Korea don&#8217;t possess. This is why they are being placed in Poland, which, as every geography student in Texas knows, shares a border with both rogue states.</p>
<p>They permit us to look forward to a glowing future, in which missile defence, according to the Pentagon, will &#8220;protect our homeland &#8230; and our friends and allies from ballistic missile attack&#8221;; as long as the Russians wait until it&#8217;s working before they nuke us. The good news is that, at the present rate of progress, reliable missile defence is only 50 years away. The bad news is that it has been 50 years away for the past six decades.</p>
<p>The system has been in development since 1946, and so far it has achieved a grand total of nothing. You wouldn&#8217;t know it if you read the press releases published by the Pentagon&#8217;s missile defence agency: the word &#8220;success&#8221; features more often than any other noun.</p>
<p>It is true that the programme has managed to hit two out of the five missiles fired over the past five years during tests of its main component, the ground-based midcourse missile defence (GMD) system. But, sadly, these tests bear no relation to anything resembling a real nuclear strike.</p>
<p>All the trials run so far &#8211; successful or otherwise &#8211; have been rigged. The target, its type, trajectory and destination, are known before the test begins. Only one enemy missile is used, as the system doesn&#8217;t have a hope in hell of knocking down two or more. If decoy missiles are deployed, they bear no resemblance to the target and they are identified as decoys in advance. In order to try to enhance the appearance of success, recent flight tests have become even less realistic: the agency has now stopped using decoys altogether when testing its GMD system.</p>
<p>This points to one of the intractable weaknesses of missile defence: it is hard to see how the interceptors could ever outwit enemy attempts to confuse them. As Philip Coyle &#8211; formerly a senior official at the Pentagon with responsibility for missile defence &#8211; points out, there are endless means by which another state could fool the system. For every real missile it launched, it could dispatch a host of dummies with the same radar and infra-red signatures. Even balloons or bits of metal foil would render anything resembling the current system inoperable. You can reduce a missile&#8217;s susceptibility to laser penetration by 90% by painting it white. This sophisticated avoidance technology, available from your local hardware shop, makes another multibillion component of the programme obsolete. Or you could simply forget about ballistic missiles and attack using cruise missiles, against which the system is useless.</p>
<p>Missile defence is so expensive and the measures required to evade it so cheap that if the US government were serious about making the system work it would bankrupt the country, just as the arms race helped to bring the Soviet Union down. By spending a couple of billion dollars on decoy technologies, Russia would commit the US to trillions of dollars of countermeasures. The cost ratios are such that even Iran could outspend the US.</p>
<p>The US has spent between $120bn and $150bn on the programme since Ronald Reagan relaunched it in 1983.</p>
<p>Under George Bush, the costs have accelerated. The Pentagon has requested $62bn for the next five-year tranche, which means that the total cost between 2003 and 2013 will be $110bn. Yet there are no clear criteria for success. As a recent paper in the journal Defense and Security Analysis shows, the Pentagon invented a new funding system in order to allow the missile defence programme to evade the government&#8217;s usual accounting standards. It&#8217;s called spiral development, which is quite appropriate, because it ensures that the costs spiral out of control.</p>
<p>Spiral development means, in the words of a Pentagon directive, that &#8220;the end-state requirements are not known at programme initiation&#8221;. Instead, the system is allowed to develop in whatever way officials think fit. The result is that no one has the faintest idea what the programme is supposed to achieve, or whether it has achieved it. There are no fixed dates, no fixed costs for any component of the programme, no penalties for slippage or failure, no standards of any kind against which the system can be judged. And this monstrous scheme is still incapable of achieving what a few hundred dollars&#8217; worth of diplomacy could do in an afternoon.</p>
<p>So why commit endless billions to a programme that is bound to fail? I&#8217;ll give you a clue: the answer is in the question. It persists because it doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>US politics, because of the failure by both Republicans and Democrats to deal with the problems of campaign finance, is rotten from head to toe. But under Bush, the corruption has acquired Nigerian qualities. Federal government is a vast corporate welfare programme, rewarding the industries that give millions of dollars in political donations with contracts worth billions. Missile defence is the biggest pork barrel of all, the magic pudding that won&#8217;t run out, however much you eat. The funds channelled to defence, aerospace and other manufacturing and service companies will never run dry because the system will never work.</p>
<p>To keep the pudding flowing, the administration must exaggerate the threats from nations that have no means of nuking it &#8211; and ignore the likely responses of those that do. Russia is not without its own corrupting influences. You could see the grim delight of the Russian generals and defence officials last week, who have found in this new deployment an excuse to enhance their power and demand bigger budgets. Poor old Poland, like the Czech Republic and the UK, gets strongarmed into becoming America&#8217;s groundbait.</p>
<p>If we seek to understand American foreign policy in terms of a rational engagement with international problems, or even as an effective means of projecting power, we are looking in the wrong place. The government&#8217;s interests have always been provincial. It seeks to appease lobbyists, shift public opinion at crucial stages of the political cycle, accommodate crazy Christian fantasies and pander to television companies run by eccentric billionaires. The US does not really have a foreign policy. It has a series of domestic policies which it projects beyond its borders. That they threaten the world with 57 varieties of destruction is of no concern to the current administration. The only question of interest is who gets paid and what the political kickbacks will be. <strong> </strong><em> <a href="http://www.bulatlat.com/" style="font-weight: bold"> (Posted by Bulatlat.com)</a></em></p>

Vol. VIII, No. 29, August 24-30, 2008</strong></p>
<p>From Nigeria to the Philippines, Mexico to India, insurgents are finding new ways to mobilise rage. It is in Afghanistan that the tactical impact will be most sharply felt.</p>
<p>The five-day war between Georgia and Russia, and the opening week of the Olympic games in Beijing, captured much of the world&#8217;s and the media&#8217;s attention in the second week of August 2008. It is not surprising, then, that events in the continuing, low-level &#8211; though increasingly dangerous &#8211; war in Afghanistan have been relatively under-reported. After all, who wants to read about an asymmetrical war between rural insurgents and advanced military powers that will soon enter its eighth year?</p>
<p>It is a question that will need no answer from the family or colleagues of the British soldier killed by a suicide-bomb on 11 August; or from those of the four workers of the humanitarian group the International Rescue Committee (IRC) who were killed as they drove from Gardez in southwest Afghanistan to Kabul on 13 August (an incident that has led the IRC indefinitely to suspend its operations in the country after twenty years of work); or from those of the Afghan civilians who continue to die on a regular basis as a result of bombing-raids by NATO / International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) air-strikes.</p>
<p>But even without the headlines, the conflict in Afghanistan has an impact on many more than the bereaved &#8211; and the signs are that this impact is set to intensify as the tactical sophistication of the insurgents increases. A graphic report on 13 August from Kabul by the BBC&#8217;s Afghanistan correspondent, pointing out that Taliban militias had greatly increased their level of targeting of the supply-lines into Kabul, illustrates how the war is spreading (see Alastair Leithead, &#8220;Taleban at Kabul&#8217;s doorstep&#8221;, BBC, 13 August 2008). A much-vaunted success of economic regeneration after the termination of the Taliban regime in November 2001 was Highway One, the main route into Kabul; but it is now repeatedly the target of the revitalised Taliban insurgents.</p>
<p>The BBC report states that fifty-one trucks have been destroyed in attacks on the highway since mid-July 2008 alone. This is just one indication of a concentration on supply-routes that has been evolving for over a year . Such intensity of focus presents serious problems even to the best-equipped and most technologically advanced armies in the world (see Sami Yousafzai &#038; Ron Moreau, &#8220;The Taliban&#8217;s Baghdad strategy&#8221; , 26 July 2008).</p>
<p><strong>From Kabul to the Niger delta</strong></p>
<p>This trend in Afghanistan is paralleled by similar instances of paramilitary targeting of critical economic infrastructure by other groups around the world &#8211; as far afield as Mexico, the Philippines, Nigeria and India. Their individual and local projects have the ability to cause disruption that has global effects, though they have yet to be registered alongside the discussion of the performance of higher-profile militant groups (see Anton La Guardia, &#8220;Al-Qaeda: Winning or losing?&#8221;, Economist, 17 July 2008).</p>
<p>An earlier column in this series pointed to this emerging cluster, citing also events in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere (see &#8220;The asymmetry of economic war&#8221;, 14 February 2008). In the six months since it was published, there have been numerous further incidents of this kind. There is, for example, a new emphasis on economic targeting by the resurgent Naxalite rebels in India; such tactics are particularly effective in a rapidly growing economy where the infrastructure is already struggling to keep up with demand and is therefore vulnerable to even small-scale operations (see &#8220;China and India: heartlands of global protest&#8221;, 7 August 2008).</p>
<p>This was also the experience in Mexico in 2007 where the previously marginal Marxist EPR insurgents staged multiple attacks on oil-and-gas pipelines. The EPR continued these tactics three months ago while rejecting talks with the Mexican government (see Mark Joyce, &#8220;Mexican pipeline bombers reject talks&#8221;, Jane&#8217;s Intelligence Review, June 2008). Meanwhile, the (Maoist) New People&#8217;s Army in the Philippines has extended its operations against power lines, telecommunications centres and roads to include mining operations as the Philippines&#8217; extractive industries experience rapid investment by foreign companies (see Gavin Greenwood, &#8220;Rich Seam&#8221;, Jane&#8217;s Intelligence Review, July 2008).</p>
<p>Even such examples of disruption in India, Mexico and the Philippines are small-scale, however, compared to the problems experienced by the Nigerian oil industry. These have evolved over several years, but in 2008 have become much more serious.</p>
<p>The oil-production systems in the Niger delta are broadly grouped into three zones: the operations based on land, those in the swamps and shallow waters of the coastal delta, and deep-water operations that are relatively recent but have become very productive. The on-shore facilities have long been subject to sabotage by a number of local militias resentful at what is seen as the riches of their region being siphoned off to Nigeria&#8217;s elites. More recently there has been an increase in attacks on the swamp and shallow-water facilities, notwithstanding the difficult terrain that needs to be crossed in reaching them.</p>

<a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article20483.htm">Information Clearing House</a><br />
<strong>ALTERNATIVE READER<br />
Posted by <em> <a href="http://www.bulatlat.com/" style="font-weight: bold"> Bulatlat.com</a></em><br />
Vol. VIII, No. 28, August 17-23, 2008</strong></p>
<p><em>“Although it is not true that all conservatives are stupid people, it is true that most stupid people are conservative.” &#8212; John Stuart Mill</em></p>
<p>11/08/08 &#8220;<a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/">ICH</a>&#8221; Many years ago, during the 1970s if memory serves, neoconservative Irving Kristol, echoing John Stuart Mill, called his <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Neoconservatism-Autobiography-Idea-Irving-Kristol/dp/toc/1566632285">conservative party</a>, the Republican Party, “the stupid party.</p>
<p>Kristol was referring to the Republicans’ inability to compete on the policy front. Jack Kemp and Ronald Reagan led the Republicans out of the wilderness, but now Republicans have reverted to the stupid party, or more precisely the moronic party.</p>
<p>Take a minute to examine the presidential campaign propaganda that Republicans send around the Internet, and you will see what I mean. For example, recently while Obama was traveling abroad, showing himself to the remnant of our allies, Republican political operatives blitzed the Internet with the suggestion that Obama might not be an American citizen. Doubt was cast on either of his parents being American citizens. The message went on to suggest that Obama refused to produce his birth certificate. All the while, Obama was traveling abroad on a US passport, a document that cannot be obtained without a US birth certificate.</p>
<p>Considering that the Republican candidate, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/28/us/politics/28mccain.html?_r=2&#038;adxnnl=1&#038;oref=slogin&#038;adxnnlx=1218385762-Ap1AsEajnjAnO5XdQ4hGRg">John McCain</a>, was born in the Panama Canal Zone, only the GOP would be dumb enough to make an issue over whether the Democrats’ candidate was born in one of the 50 states.</p>
<p>The innuendo and negativism with which the Republicans are conducting their presidential campaign are unprecedented. There is no sign of issues in <a href="http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2008/07/mccain_campaign_shakeup.html">McCain’s Karl Rovian campaign</a>.</p>
<p>Republicans stand for war without end, a police state to make us “safe,” and “energy independence,” which means drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Preserve and offshore of Florida’s Gulf Coast beaches.</p>
<p>What Republicans really mean by “energy independence” is prevailing over environmentalists. Republicans lump environmentalists in the same category with abortionists, gays, feminists, food stamp recipients, trade unionists and terrorists. To a Republican, saving America means prevailing over these people.</p>
<p>The notion that Americans can achieve energy independence by drilling offshore wells and in the arctic is absurd. A number of experts have pointed out that the best data do not support any such possibility.</p>
<p>For example, Robert Kaufman at Boston University, citing U.S. government data, reports that the U.S. might have 40 billion barrels of oil in undeveloped reserves which are not off limits. Another 19 billion might be in off limit <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92677194">offshore</a> sites and in the Arctic National Wildlife preserve. </p>
<p>All of this oil cannot be brought up at once, and apparently none before 2017. Bringing it all into production would, experts think, increase US oil production by 1-4 percent. In other words, nothing. Currently the US uses 21 million barrels a day, and the entire world uses 86 million barrels a day. At best, the Arctic Wildlife Refuge could by 2017 produce 1 million barrels a day, about one-twentieth of current US use and one-eighty-sixth of current world use.</p>
<p>This is not energy independence, and it would have no material effect on price. Indeed, the offshoring by US corporations of US jobs has a much greater effect on the dollar price of oil by inflating the U.S. trade deficit and driving down the exchange value of the U.S. dollar. But, of course, here we are talking about facts, and facts are of no interest to Republicans.</p>
<p>Republicans are interested in prevailing over the “bad guys.” The fact that the bad guys are Bush, Cheney, Rice, Wolfowitz, Perle, Billy Kristol, and other such is beyond the Republicans’ imagination. Bad guys are “towel heads” with beards and robes and are “over there” where they must be killed before the come “over here.” The extent of the Republican intellect boils down to “over here” vs. “over there.”</p>
<p>The other great bugaboo of Republicans is “the liberal media.” Fox “News” has Republicans convinced that “the liberal media” is endangering America by siding with terrorists.</p>
<p>Clearly, Republicans never look at “the liberal media.” It was Judith Miller at the “liberal” New York Times who served up as fact all the neocon disinformation about Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction and al Qaeda connections. Without the New York Times leading the way, the neocons could never have pulled off their illegal invasions.</p>
<p>On July 18, 2008, the New York Times allowed the Israeli Benny Morris to spew lies about Iran that he used to justify an attack on that country possibly even involving nuclear weapons. This is the same New York Times that the idiot conservatives believe is part of “the liberal media.”</p>
<p>It was <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/08/01/anthrax/print.html">ABC News</a> that served up the neocon disinformation that the anthrax had been traced to Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>And, today, August 9, 2008, as I write, it is the “liberal” Washington Post that has written an editorial urging the US to go to war with Russia.</p>
<p>With its editorial, “Stopping Russia: the US and its allies must unite against Moscow’s war on Georgia,” the Washington Post has established a world record for the maximum number of lies in the minimum number of words.</p>
<p>Except for the Washington Post, the entire world knows that Georgia (the birthplace of Joseph Stalin, not Georgia USA) initiated the aggression that killed Russian peacekeepers and hundreds of civilians in South Ossetia, peacekeepers who were there with the blessing of Georgia and international agreements.</p>
<p>The true facts are available all over the world press. But the “liberal” Washington Post serves up the lie that Russia has attacked Georgia and conceivably plans to conquer all of Georgia. “This is a grave challenge to the United States and Europe,” thunders the Bush Regime’s mouthpiece, aka, “the liberal media.”</p>
<p>Thirsting for blood, the “liberal media” declares: “The United States and its NATO allies must together impose a price on Russia.”</p>

</strong><br />
Another moment of truth approaches. While Washington finally joined talks with Tehran, Congress is still considering a resolution calling for an air, sea and land blockade of Iran, opening one path to war.</span></p>
<p>What is the relationship between U.S. imperialism and the Islamic Republic of Iran? Will the talks lead to an agreement or will the U.S. warships in the Gulf— or the Israeli military—unleash a massive air attack against the Iranian people? What is the stake for workers and the oppressed in the U.S.?</p>
<p>The U.S. is the wealthiest, most militarized imperialist state. The Pentagon’s role is to impose U.S. diplomatic and economic policy on the world, to control raw materials, to police worldwide ocean trading lanes, and to impose the power of the U.S.-based multinational corporations to super-exploit workers worldwide, including workers inside the U.S. Washington is the home office of world repression and exploitation. Israel is its branch office.</p>
<p>The Iranian state is the result of a popular revolution in 1979 that overthrew the shah, a monarchic dictator. A CIA-directed conspiracy had re-installed this shah in 1953, deposing an elected government. The shah, armed and backed by U.S. imperialism, had his military and police murder tens of thousands of people in his failed attempt to stop the 1979 revolution. This revolution stopped short of overturning capitalist social relations in Iran, but it broke the grip of the imperialist corporations and opened the door to social development in Iran.</p>
<p>There is no doubt a sovereign and independent Iran has the right to trade with whatever countries it chooses, to explore possible energy supplies, including nuclear energy, and even to prepare for self-defense with nuclear weapons. The U.S. possesses almost limitless nuclear weapons and Israel is suspected of possessing 200; these states are both declared enemies of Iran. Nearby India and Pakistan also possess at least some of these weapons, without U.S. hostility.</p>
<p>Washington has just signed a pact helping nuclear-armed India develop its civilian nuclear power, even though the U.S. excuse for threatening Iran is Tehran’s program for developing civilian nuclear power. Last December, 16 U.S. spy agencies reported that there is no evidence that Iran has a nuclear weapons program. Prevention of nuclear proliferation is the U.S. cover story. Iran’s independence from imperialism, its sovereignty and its oil reserves are the real reasons why Washington has targeted the Islamic Republic.</p>
<p>The next question is—despite Bush’s weakened position as the most unpopular president since Richard Nixon in his final days in office, despite Bush’s isolation from not only the U.S. population but sectors of the Pentagon brass who fear the stress and strain on their ground troops after the setbacks in Iraq and Afghanistan, despite the potential for a disastrous explosion in the Middle East and the entire Muslim world, despite the possibility of a massive increase in the price of oil, despite all these dangers—will the Bush gang use what it believes is overwhelming U.S. air power to attack Iran, perhaps following an initial strike by Israel?</p>
<p>A look at the history of imperialist adventures in World Wars I and II, up to the assault on Iraq in 2003, shows that it would be foolish to rule out the possibility of a new adventure simply because that aggression might become another enormous setback for U.S. imperialism itself—not to mention a horror for 70 million Iranian people. The Bush gang, the oil monopolies and the military-industrial complex might be all too ready to back such a risky move. We cannot rule out that the deepening, unsolvable economic crisis might drive imperialism to another war.</p>
<p>For U.S. workers of all nationalities facing unemployment, foreclosures and evictions, not only would such a war be a distraction from their necessary struggle for economic justice, it would be an additional disaster, no matter the outcome. They must mobilize to stop this new war. It is the responsibility of the anti-war movement and the entire workers’ movement to take this danger seriously and organize the kind of independent struggle that can stop it. <strong>Posted by <em><a href="http://www.bulatlat.com/" style="font-weight: strong">(Bulatlat.com)</a></em></strong></p>

Vol. VIII, No. 25, July 27-August 2, 2008</strong></p>
<p>Texas Congressman Ron Paul has warned the House that he is &#8220;convinced the time is now upon us that some Big Events are about to occur.&#8221; that will cause liberty to go &#8220;into deep hibernation&#8221;.</p>
<p>Paul told the House, &#8220;These fast-approaching events will not go unnoticed. They will affect all of us. Theconomy and political system will share in the chaos about to be unley will not be limited to just some areas of our country. The world eashed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are reasons to believe this coming crisis is different and bigger than the world has ever experienced. Instead of using globalism in a positive fashion, it&#8217;s been used to globalize all of the mistakes of the politicians, bureaucrats and central bankers,&#8221; Paul continued.</p>
<p>In one of Paul&#8217;s most memorable speeches to date, the Congressman spoke of rampant authoritarianism having replaced the principles of liberty that the United States was founded upon and warned that current empire building financed through inflation and debt signals a most frightening period in history.</p>

Vol. VIII, No. 24, July 20-26, 2008</strong></p>
<p>With the economic news of the week of July 14—the continuing crisis among mortgage lenders, the onset of bank failures, the announced downsizing of General Motors, the slide of the Dow-Jones below 11,000—we are seeing the ongoing collapse of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>Even the super-rich are becoming nervous as cries for an emergency suspension of short selling ring out.</p>
<p>What is really taking place, however, is that the producing economy of working men and women is being crushed by the overall debt burden on households, businesses, and governments that could reach $70 trillion by 2010. The financial system, including mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, is bankrupt, as the debts it is based on cannot be repaid.</p>
<p>This is because the producing economy of people who work for a living simply can no longer generate enough purchasing power for people either to pay their debts or allow them to purchase what is being sold in the marketplace. In turn it is the debt burden and the loss of societal purchasing power that are crashing the stock market. Thus the collapse of the financial economy has started to destroy the producing economy as well.</p>
<p>It’s a “perfect storm,” the result of a 200-year-old financial system where money is largely created by bank lending and where since 1980 our industry and jobs have been increasingly outsourced abroad to cheap labor markets. Thus domestic incomes have stagnated while the nation’s GDP has not been able to keep up with the exponential growth of debt.</p>
<p>While the mainstream media are blind, deaf, and dumb as to the causes, the victims within the middle and working classes are seeing their livelihoods ruined, jobs taken away, pensions eroded, homes foreclosed on, and are being saddled with ever-increasing debt and forced to work under more and more stress due to rising burdens of taxation, gas and food price inflation, and bureaucratic rules and regulations. The only places a more-or-less normal life may still be possible will be the wealthiest imperial centers like Washington, New York, Houston, Chicago, or San Francisco.</p>
<p>All that the current bailouts being engineered by the Federal Reserve are doing is to create more debt to shore up failing financial institutions. No new wealth is being created. It’s band-aids on band-aids.</p>
<p>The problem politically is that control of the U.S. long ago was turned over to the bankers and the financiers of the Western world. It was called financial “deregulation,” accelerated under President Ronald Reagan, and has run amok since then. From a longer historical view, it’s the same phenomenon that first created and then ruined the British Empire , and it’s what created and is now ruining the American Empire today.</p>
<p>A side-effect of control by the bankers and financiers is that they are also Zionists, so we have the added multi-trillion dollar burden of trying to conquer the Middle East on behalf of the international oil interests and the state of Israel .</p>
<p>The situation has deteriorated sharply since the 1970s as U.S. affairs have been managed on behalf of the financial interests by what you might call the “Three Amigos”—Henry Kissinger, Paul Volcker, and Alan Greenspan. Kissinger, while Nixon’s secretary of state, made the U.S. dependent on the Middle East for oil, lavished billions on Israel ’s war machine, and created the petrodollar to support our trade and fiscal deficits. Volcker, while chairman of the Federal Reserve, crashed the U.S. producing economy in the recession of 1979-1983, leading to the rise of the “service economy.” Greenspan, during his own Federal Reserve chairmanship, presided over the bubble economy which was created through massive official fraud in home mortgage lending and is now sinking like the Titanic.</p>
<p>The politicians have enabled these financial crimes. Above all it’s been the Bush family which has served as a political Trojan Horse for the financiers for three generations, with affairs having become much worse since George H.W. Bush invaded Iraq for the first time in 1991. The enablers have included a majority of the members of the U.S. Congress. (See the conclusion of Patrick Buchanan’s new book, Churchill, Hitler, and the Unnecessary War for an account of how the U.S. since the Bush I presidency has replicated the catastrophic errors of failed British imperialism.)</p>
<p>The American people are not entirely innocent. We have been so lulled to sleep by the financier-owned media that we have allowed these disasters to take place and are now reaping the consequences. We have been the fodder for their wars and the signers of their loans. We have tried to carve out our own piece of the pie which is now crumbling.</p>
<p>What is taking place is not just the collapse of the U.S. , but more than likely the final crash of Western civilization, since we are the last of the world empires to go down the drain. World War I saw the end of the German, Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and Ottoman empires. World War II saw the disappearance of the French, British, Japanese, and Italian empires, along with Nazi Germany. The Soviet empire collapsed in 1991. The American is next. The danger is that we may lash out and start a nuclear World War III out of frustration and to appease the elitists of the world who see war and famine as their pathway to world control. Such a war would also mean a military takeover domestically to manage the pathetically weak nation that we are becoming.</p>
