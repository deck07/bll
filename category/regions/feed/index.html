<p>“Instead of pursuing a senseless all-out war, the President should devote more government efforts to carry on peace negotiations with revolutionary groups, especially with the CPP-NPA-NDFP, and resolve the roots of armed conflict, which is social injustice.”</p>
<p>MANILA – Mother’s Day usually means the two children of Aileen “Ka Pia” Serna, a member of the New People’s Army (NPA), would receive at least a phone call from her. This Mother’s Day and in the years to come, that will no longer happen for the two children. Serna was killed in a firefight with the 76th Infantry Battalion-Philippine Army (76IBPA) troops in Sta. Cruz, Occidental Mindoro on May 8.</p>
<p>This Mother’s Day, her children reunited with her for the last time when the mother’s closed casket was brought to their home. The Buhay na Alay para sa Nagkakaisang Mindoro (BAYANIMO), an alliance of victims of human rights violations in Mindoro, grieved with her children. </p>
<p>Rev. Glofie Baluntong, the spokesperson of BAYANIMO, said moments such as this comprise the tragic price of President Rodrigo Duterte’s all-out war policy.<br />
<figure id="attachment_97276" style="width: 213px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/serna_aileen_fr_bayanimo-213x300.jpg" alt="allout war" width="213" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-97276" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Aileen F. Serna 1979-2017</figcaption></figure><br />
“Instead of pursuing a senseless all-out war, the President should devote more government efforts to carry on peace negotiations with revolutionary groups, especially with the CPP-NPA-NDFP, and resolve the roots of armed conflict, which is social injustice,” Baluntong said.</p>
<p>On Monday, May 15, BAYANIMO is set to conduct a fact-finding mission in Sta. Cruz, Occidental Mindoro. After the firefight on May 8 that took a mother’s life, reports reached the group that the government troops also committed many other cases of human rights abuses in the area.</p>
<p>“Duterte’s all-out war policy is seriously disrupting people’s lives and violating their civil rights; this policy is becoming more and more a war against the people,” Baluntong said.</p>
<p>BAYANIMO is disturbed to see that Duterte’s ‘inner circle’ is fast becoming “dominated by technocrats and military officials.” But Baluntong said they still “strongly hold out for a peace platform that this government has promised. </p>
<p>May 13 marks the full year since President Rodrigo R. Duterte was elected to the presidency. </p>
<p>In another statement, Karapatan Sorsogon said the overwhelming vote given to Duterte was a sheer expression of the people’s desire for meaningful change and their response to the promises he made in the heat of the electoral campaign. Similar to the calls from the Mindoro rights alliance, Karapatan Sorsogon urged the Duterte administration to flesh out his campaign slogans and promises. It protested the administration’s all-out war including its drugs war, saying the poor and the impoverished Filipinos are the real victims of this “murderous rampage.”<br />

<p>Women play a vital role in society and their socio-economic needs must be addressed so they could fully realize their potential.</p>
<p><strong>By ZOFIA LEAL</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat</a></em></p>
<p>VIGAN CITY &#8212; More than a hundred women from different organizations, institutions and municipalities convened in Baluarte, Vigan City last September 23 for the Ilocos Sur Women’s Summit.</p>
<p>An offshoot of the National Women’s Summit held in Davao City last June, the Ilocos Sur Women’s Summit aimed to discuss the platform of women for CHANGE &#8211; Comprehensive social services, Human rights, peace and social justice, Anti-discrimination and anti-violence against women and children; National sovereignty, Genuine land reform and national industrialization, and Environmental protection and disaster preparedness &#8211; and to come up with the Ilocos Sur Women’s Agenda.</p>
<p>Gabriela Women’s Party Representative Arlene Brosas gave the keynote speech and explained the need to address the root causes of the vulnerabilities of women. Brosas reiterated that women play a vital role in society and their socio-economic needs must be addressed so they could fully realize their potential. </p>
<p>The peace talks between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines was also discussed. Brosas explained that the current talks to come up with the Comprehensive Agreement on Socio-Economic Reforms would be beneficial to women. </p>
<p>“For example, one of the provisions is to address the rights of the working class, their livelihood and access to social services. This means that the government will ensure the health and other social services needed by the people, especially women and children. The responsibility of child-rearing is not just on the mother or the parents, but is also a function of the government,” Brosas said.<br />
Kristine Joy Haban, deputy secretary of Gabriela Women’s Party for Visayas, then shared the results of the National Women’s Summit. </p>
<p>Inputs on the national and local situation of women regarding comprehensive social services, human rights, anti-discrimination and anti-violence against women and children, national sovereignty and environmental protection and disaster preparedness were given by different speakers. </p>

<p>Paola Espiritu, spokesperson of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan – Ilocos discussed the possible effects of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) Framework on the vegetable farmers of Ilocos Sur. At least three municipalities in the province produce cauliflower and broccoli which are then transported to Baguio, Pangasinan or Metro Manila. The vegetable farmers shoulder all the expenses needed such as pesticide, fertilizer and seedlings while having to deal with no proper irrigation. Some of the farmers also do not own the land they till and still have to pay rent to the land owners. With the AEC, the vegetable farmers might not be able to cope with the entry of imported produce that can be sold much lower than the local produce. </p>
<p>Espiritu explained that what happened to the price surge of garlic might happen again if the AEC continues and the ones that will be affected the most are the farmers. </p>
<p>Other speakers are Board Member Mika Mendoza, lawyer Louie Santos, Beth Alfiler of Amihan-Ilocos and Vice Mayor Jeremy Jesus Bueno III.</p>
<p>After the inputs, the participants were divided into workshop groups to talk about the problems and possible solutions that will become part of the Ilocos Sur Women’s Agenda.  </p>
<p>Included in the proposed solutions are: to create a doctor to the barrios program, increase the capacity of the Barangay Council for the Protection of Children and Anti-VAW desks to handle cases of abuse, creation of a Center for Women, support for the peace talks between the GRP and the NDFP, and the requirement for quarry companies to deposit a rehabilitation fund in the communities where they operate.</p>
<p>Board Member Christopher Baterina acted as the reactor and commended the participants for coming up with the proposed solutions. </p>
<p>The summit was spearheaded by the Ilocos Center for Research, Empowerment and Development (ICRED) in partnership with Amihan-Ilocos and Provincial Board Member Mika Mendoza. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat " src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

“Yolanda victims are still without aid, still living in bunkhouses, yet the government is prioritizing the building of tide embankments, and hotels.”</p>
<p><strong>By MARYA SALAMAT</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></strong></p>
<p>MANILA – Nearly two years since supertyphoon Yolanda battered eastern Visayas, the typhoon survivors held a regional conference in Tacloban City to take stock of their rehabilitation, or the lack of it, and to let the country know about their real situation.</p>
<p>“It took one year for Aquino to release the rehabilitation master plan. But instead of helping the survivors, he focused on politicking disaster aid and prioritized how he could<a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2014/03/21/aquino-forum-on-post-yolanda-reconstruction-just-meaningless-chatter-typhoon-survivors/"> save face from the disaster</a> survivors’ legitimate dissent.” This is how Marissa Cabaljao, secretary general of People Surge Alliance for Disaster Survivors in the Philippines (People Surge), had summarized government response.</p>
<p>The disaster survivors’ conference hosted by People Surge gathered this Tuesday, November 3, representatives of disaster survivors from different sectors in the region, including farmers, urban poor, workers and students. Speaking at the conference, Cabaljao noted that Aquino could have fast-tracked the rehabilitation process by disbursing the P923 million ($20 million)  disaster funds, which reports said remain idle in banks. </p>
<p>“But Aquino seems to be reserving this money for only God knows what,” she said. </p>
<p>Most believed Aquino would be using the disaster rehabilitation funds to bankroll instead the campaign and planned election “victory” of Liberal Party candidates in the national elections next year.</p>
<p>People Surge members vowed to refute the Aquino administration’s expected lies and excuses concerning its “achievements” at helping the disaster survivors.</p>
<p>“The disaster survivors’ testimonies are real. We speak from our <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2013/12/02/people-in-samar-leyte-still-hungry-despite-govt-claims-of-moving-forward-from-relief-to-rehabilitation/">concrete experiences </a>on the grassroots and not from the ivory tower of Malacañang,” Cabaljao said.</p>
<p><strong>Eastern Visayas the poorest region now because of unaided disaster victims? </strong></p>
<p>After Yolanda struck, the region especially the most affected provinces were excluded in government labor surveys. This year, nearly two years since supertyphoon Yolanda (international name Haiyan) lashed this region of fisherfolk and coconut and food crop farmers, Leyte was still not covered in the April 2015 survey because of the large number of households which were displaced by typhoon Yolanda, <a href="https://psa.gov.ph/content/employment-situation-april-2015%C2%B9-final-results">according to the Philippine Statistics Authority</a>. </p>
<p><figure id="attachment_86454" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/peoplesurge_disastersurv1.jpg"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/peoplesurge_disastersurv1.jpg" alt="People Surge on disaster and rehabilitation" width="640" height="427" class="size-full wp-image-86454" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/peoplesurge_disastersurv1.jpg 640w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/peoplesurge_disastersurv1-547x365.jpg 547w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/peoplesurge_disastersurv1-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Members of People Surge registering for their first regional conference in Tacloban City, Nov. 3 (Contributed Photo / Bulatlat.com)<br /></figcaption></figure><br />
In Leyte, after wrapping up their first regional conference of disaster survivors, Dr Elfleda Bautista, chairman of People Surge, told <em>Bulatlat.com</em> their people is even worse off today because succeeding typhoons (after Haiyan) “completed the devastation of the region.” Typhoons Glenda, Ruby and Seniang pummeled the provinces that had been least destroyed by Yolanda.</p>
<p>Bautista said Typhoon Ruby (Hagupit) affected Southern Leyte and Northern Leyte, two provinces that had been only 10-percent ravaged by Yolanda. “Although Ruby was not as strong (as Yolanda), it brought strong rains and lingered in the region for days,” said Bautista. Ruby (Hagupit) was the second most intense tropical cyclone in 2014. With a maximum strength of 175 kph windspeed, it first made landfall over Eastern Samar on December 6 last year. </p>
<p>Typhoon Seniang (Jangmi), brought flooding and landslide in Eastern Visayas since late December also last year. Most of the areas it inundated with heavy rains were<a href="www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/12/31/1408038/seniang-kills-35"> those still reeling from the aftermath of Ruby (Hagupit</a>). </p>
<p>It killed more than Ruby because of the landslide.</p>
<p>“If before Yolanda, Region 8 was second to the poorest, after Yolanda, we’re probably the poorest,” said Bautista.</p>
<p>Up to now, Seniang survivors rendered homeless are still in an evacuation center at the Catbalogan gym. A family of a teacher and former OFW lost their children to landslide during Seniang. They reportedly received P10,000 ($214) in burial assistance from the government. They have yet to rebuild their homes.</p>
<p><strong>Aquino government’s slow, inadequate response hit</strong></p>
<p>Amid the Aquino government’s lackluster response, the disaster survivors continued to source aid only from international and local non-government organizations, according to reports in the regional conference of survivors in Tacloban this Tuesday. </p>
<p>They said they also had to conduct collective protest actions just to get a portion of the reported aid supposedly coming their way. </p>
<p>In Palo, Leyte, 100 families had to press the government through mass actions so they would be included among target beneficiaries of government’s ESA (Emergency Shelter Assistance). Bautista said the government had excluded them because they were at a work –for-shelter arrangement with a non-government group. </p>
<p>“But where will we get food?” members of these families asked. They shared their experience in demanding to be included in the government’s list of beneficiaries and holding collective action.  They did not receive aid in building shelter from the government, but some 50 of these families reportedly received P10,000 ($214) in aid. “Mainly to prevent them from holding rallies,” said Bautista.</p>
<p>Another report to the survivors’ conference was the “dagdag-bawas” (addition-subtraction) in aid and relief. </p>
<p>Bautista said some of the reported government aid and relief were indeed released, but survivors revealed that in some barangay (villages),  some families were removed, without explanation, on the list of beneficiaries. Some remained but what they should have received as earlier announced was slashed or downgraded. For example, from receiving aid for totally damaged homes, they were given aid for partially damaged homes (or a reduction from P30,000 to P10,000, or $641 to $214).</p>
<p>Bautista said survivors also reported their names were stricken off the list of aid beneficiaries when it became known they were active at joining protests.</p>
<p><strong>2nd Yolanda anniversary protest</strong></p>
<p>On November 6, survivors not just of Typhoon Yolanda but also of succeeding tropical storms are set to “occupy” a part of Tacloban City in protest of the Aquino government’s inadequate response. People Surge said it will spearhead a mobilization in protest of government inaction, and slow release of disaster funds.</p>

“Nakanganga pa sa mga bunkhouses ang mga biktima ng Yolanda samantalang inuuna ang proyektong tide embankment, ang daming hotels na itinatayo,” (Yolanda victims are still without aid, still living in bunkhouses, yet the government is prioritizing the building of tide embankments, and hotels,” Bautista said during the press conference of the storm survivors also held this Tuesday in Tacloban City. </p>
<p>A 21-km long tide embankment being constructed along Tacloban, Palo, and Tanauan areas in Leyte is affecting and dislocating many communities, according to the survivors’ conference. </p>
<p>Last week, Aquino and Roxas visited Eastern Samar to check on the billion-peso- US grant project of circumferential road network that they say will connect Eastern and Northern Samar.</p>
<p>But People Surge found these visits just proof of how Aquino “prioritizes more the interest of US imperialist over the plight of his own people.”</p>
<p>Cabaljao said in another statement the circumferential road network Aquino and Roxas visited is located on the site of a former US naval depot and air strip during World War II. Locals said foreign troops have been repeatedly seen at the area. In the light of the reported US pivot in Asia, there were talks that the US might be reopening its former bases in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Dr. Bautista reiterated that even as they are still reeling from the succession of storms, still unable to rise up fully and recover, there were <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2014/12/05/eastern-visayas-folk-appeal-for-support-as-they-battle-storms-poverty-militarization/">complaints of militarization</a> hampering the people’s recovery of their livelihoods. </p>
<p>“The people can’t attend to their farms because the military accost them and accuse them of being members or supporters of New People’s Army,” Bautista said. </p>

<p><strong>By ZEA IO MING C. CAPISTRANO</strong><br />
<a href="http://davaotoday.com/main/economy/world-class-filipino-maglev-train-cheaper-way-to-solve-traffic/">Davao Today</a></p>
<p>DAVAO CITY – The Filipino inventor of the hybrid monorail – which uses magnets – believes that his invention is the cheaper way to solve the traffic problem in the country.</p>
<p>Architect Jose Guardo, Jr. in a press conference on Monday said maglev or magnetic levitation train “is a technology made of lightweight materials which uses electromagnets and neodymium iron boron to create repulsions from the lower part and enable the train to levitate and propel the coach”.</p>
<p>He said Japan and Germany are the first to use this technology.</p>
<p>Japan, Guardo said, has broken the record of 603 kilometers per hour. He said in Shanghai, China, where they use Germany’s invention, the 30-kilometer travel from Pudong International Airport to Lin Yang station “only takes eight minutes running at 430 kilometers an hour.”</p>
<p>“In our invention, we don’t aim for high speed yet because our stations are nearer. Probably we can make it 300 kilometers an hour when traveling long distance. But between station to station, it’s just 65-85 kilometers an hour,” he said.</p>
<p>Guardo said the Filipino’s version of the maglev train is cheaper than that of Germany, which costs US$40.9 million per kilometer of the rail.</p>
<p>“Here we use lightweight materials like carbon fiber and permanent magnet and aluminum for levitation which is only US$2 million per kilometer,” he said.</p>
<p>Guardo said even the materials needed for the construction of the Hybrid Maglev Monorail Train can be sourced locally.</p>
<p>“This magnet neodymium iron boron is very strong. Sixty (60) percent of magnet is made from iron which is found in Surigao, Dinagat, Zambales and Palawan,” he said.</p>
<p>“I use aluminum for levitation because it is cheaper and it is the most abundant element on earth. The neodymium iron boron is 60 percent iron, which is found in Surigao and is mined by China,” said Guardo.</p>
<p>“The buying rate of high grade (nickel) which has 70 percent iron costs US$9 per ton,” he said.</p>
<p>“This really is beneficial because we don’t need to import the train. The trains from China costs US$1.8 million per coach,” Guardo said.</p>
<p>Guardo also said that Maglev train is more low-maintenance because of its materials. He said the Metro Rail Transit’s  cost of maintenance can cost US$1 million per month while the Maglev train’s cost of maintenance is pegged at P5 million pesos a month.</p>
<p>“Maglev train levitates, so it requires less energy to propel the train,” he said.</p>
<p>He also said that they are proposing that the station here in Davao will use solar power for the train.</p>
<p>Guardo’s team proposes to put up three loops in Davao namely Ecoland loop, airport loop and the downtown loop. The loop he said will help the train avoid occupying the road right of way.</p>
<p>He said the monorail train  “will only travel one way, either clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the situation.”</p>
<p>He also said that unlike the MRT, the supporting structure of the monorail train will only measure one meter by one meter and the rail 1.5-2 meters.</p>
<p>A transportation study by the Japan International Cooperation Agency last year said that traffic congestion in Metro Manila can worsen by 2030 which can cost the Philippine economy P6 billion a day if not addressed.</p>
<p>Guardo said the project is recognized by the Department of Science and Technology 11 and is now planning to have a prototype to test the technology.</p>
<p>He said the prototype only costs P300 million.</p>
<p>Virgilio Sangutan, president of the Davao Inventors Association, said there is a plan now to utilize five hectares of the Mindanao Science Centrum in Bago Oshiro Tugbok district to design five stations. He said a coach of a Maglev train will be used to transfer visitors from a station to another.</p>
<p>Sangutan said the coach can carry 50 passengers.</p>
<p>Eduard Geguera, operation manager of the project, said they have already formed a group of support team composed of electrical engineers and mechanical engineers who are all from Davao City.</p>
<p>He said they already sent their letter proposal to Davao City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte and are still waiting for feedback.</p>
<p>“We also requested documents from the City Planning because there have been feasibility studies that were already conducted, and it is where we will base our design for elevation,” said Geguera.</p>
<p>Guardo said  “we can really claim that this is a Filipino invention. I am sure this can create jobs because we (are creating) a new industry.”</p>
<p>He said once validated, “we can also export this to other countries.” <strong><em>Reposted by</em></strong> <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://davaotoday.com/main/human-rights/bukidnon-village-chief-gives-ultimatum-for-boarding-high-school-closure/" target="_blank"><strong>By ZEA IO MING C. CAPISTRANO<br />
Davao Today</strong></a></p>
<p>DAVAO CITY — The local chief of a village in Kitaotao town Bukidnon gives a boarding high-school two days time to close their school.</p>
<p>Teacher Evelyn Cabangal of the Mindanao Interfaith Services Foundation Inc. Academy said she received Memorandum Order No. 04 Series of 2015 dated October 1.</p>
<p>The memorandum was addressed to Misfi Academy’s executive director, Percinita J. Sanchez and signed by Felipe S. Cabugnason, barangay chairman of Barangay White Culaman.</p>
<p>The memorandum reads that Sanchez is being informed that the barangay council is ordering the office of Misfi to close the school “within two days after you receive this memorandum.”</p>
<p>“Failure to comply with the said memorandum order within the timeframe given, the barangay council together with the people in our barangay will go where the school is located and we will automatically close the school,” said Cabugnason.</p>
<p>The school is located in Sitio Dao, White Culaman and currently hosts 42 Grade 7 and Grade 8 students.</p>
<p>The memorandum adds that the “barangay council decides to close the school because of lack of documents such as permit to operate.”</p>
<p>“The school is also a threat to the safety of the people living in our barangay,” said the barangay memorandum.</p>
<p>It said the school is “proven” to have links with the New People’s Army.</p>
<p>“The New People’s Army is the one who surveyed the area, led by certain NPA members Ka Makoy, Ka Ibyang and Etok who allegedly facilitated the lumbers sold for the construction of the school. The lumbers sold (were) not paid, according to the owners of the lumber,” said Cabugnason.</p>
<p>The memorandum was also signed by seven barangay councilors and an indigenous people mandatory representative (IPMR).</p>
<p>Cabangal said she was one of the pioneer teachers in the school and she has not met any of the NPA members mentioned in the memorandum.</p>
<p>“When I came here, this is already a school and I started teaching and haven’t seen those people,” she said. The school was established in June last year.</p>
<p>Cabangal said she teaches Math, Science and Values Educations. She said the school is originally housing 55 students, but after previous military operations, which happened near their school, some students left. Now they only have 42 students.</p>
<p>She said the students came as far as Arakan Valley in North Cotabato.</p>
<p>Cabangal said during the recently held Mercy Mission in Kitaotao last September 16-18 by cause-oriented groups, the school administration has already talked with the barangay officials that their concern should be sent to the office of Misfi in Indangan, Davao City.</p>
<p>Cabangal said she received the letter while they were preparing lunch at around 11:35 am. She said after receiving the memorandum she sent a mobile text to Cabugnason and reminded him to send the letter to Davao City.</p>
<p>However, Cabangal said the village chief replied to her “kamo nay tawag sa inyong staff sa Davao kay naa man moy kontak nila basta duha ra ka adlaw ang akong tagal (call your staff in Davao because you have contact with them, just remember I only gave two days as deadline).”</p>
<p>Milagros Maglungsod-Tan, education coordinator of Misfi Academy,said they have not yet received the memorandum in their office. She said that whatever happens, they will not close the school.</p>
<p>“The Board of the Directors and the administrators decided that we will not close the school,” she said.</p>
<p>She said they will also try to reach out to the local government unit in Kitaotao to get their views on the matter.</p>
<p>She said the school was built upon the request of the local farmers group Nagkahiusang Mag-uuma sa White Culaman (United Farmers of White Culaman).</p>
<p>“This is an effort and initiative of the local farmers’ organization who wished to have a secondary school near them to cater farmers and indigenous peoples,” she said.</p>
<p>She also said they do not know about the allegations pertaining to the unpaid lumber facilitated by alleged NPA members.</p>
<p>“We went through a process, we attended barangay sessions and paid courtesy to the Barangay captain who previously attended and made speeches during school activities,” said Maglungsod-Tan.</p>
<p>“We went through a lot of processes, even with the office of Municipal Mayor Lorenzo Gawilan,” she added.</p>
<p>Maglungsod-Tan also said that they have applied for the permit to operate since June last year.</p>
<p>“Since June last year, we have been submitting reports on the school’s enrollees to DepEd (Department of Education) in Malaybalay, so we only lack the formal permit to operate but the DepEd is aware of the school’s existence,” she added.</p>
<p>She said the DepEd Division of Malaybalay has inspected the school “twice”.</p>
<p>“We know our school is harassed because we lack the permit from DepEd, so we have been trying our best to follow it up with DepEd,” she said.</p>
<p>However, she said they feel sad that the village chief who was previously “very supportive” of the school is now ordering its closure.</p>
<p>“When the Army started coming in the community in August this year, he changed his views about the school,” she said.</p>
<p>“Kapitan (Cabugnason) knows about the school and our activities because he has always been present during school activities,” she added.</p>
<p>She said they were able to talk to Cabugnason during the recent mercy mission to remind him that he was very supportive of the school before, but Cabugnason told her “nag-alsa na mi mam, ang tibuok barangay mag-alsa na mi (we are rising up now, the whole barangay will rise up).”</p>
<p>“He told us ‘take your school off to somewhere else’,” she said.</p>
<p>“With our without the permit, they do not like the school to remain in the community,” said Maglungsod-Tan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Cabangal said she hopes Cabugnason will have compassion and change his mind over the order to close their school.</p>
<p>“Asa na man ang katungod sa mga kabatan-onang kabus nga ma-edukar kung ingon ani ang iyang panglantaw nga ipasirado ang among eskwelahan. Kay kani among mga estudyante diri mga kabus man intawon ni nga dili maka-afford og eskwela bisan sa public, kay walay ikabayad (What will happen to the right of the children to get education if he thinks this way and orders to close the school. Our students here came from poor families who can’t even afford to go to public school because they don’t have money),” said Cabangal.</p>
<p>“Our school is for free and we also give students free meals and school supplies,” she said. <strong>Reposted by</strong><em> <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></em></p>

<p><a href="http://davaotoday.com/main/human-rights/ip-leaders-support-groups-unsatisfied-over-chrs-public-inquiry/" target="_blank"><strong>By EARL O. CONDEZA<br />
Davao Today</strong></a></p>
<p>DAVAO CITY – The public inquiry of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) on the plight of tribal communities in southern Mindanao, held Thursday, Sept. 24, dismayed a council of tribal elders and their support groups.</p>
<p>Datu Kailo Buntolan, a leader of the Salugpungan Ta’tanu Council of Elders, expressed dismay over the set of questions that were “mostly not about the issue they are complaining about.”</p>
<p>“What the commissioners are asking us are more on the whereabouts of the New People’s Army, if they are also staying in our communities,” said Buntolan.</p>
<p>“That’s not the issue here, there are no complaints raised against the NPAs for they are not the ones who are encamping in our communities,” Buntolan added.</p>
<p>In April last year, Ata-Manobo residents from Talaingod, Davao del Norte fled their communities to seek refuge in the compound of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP) this city after they complained of being harassed by Army soldiers who also occupied their houses.</p>
<p>By April 30, they returned to their communities after the dialogue between Davao Mayor Rodrigo Duterte and Davao del Norte Gov. Rodolfo del Rosario resulted to an agreement to withdraw military operations from the affected communities.</p>
<p>A year after, however, the Talaingod Lumads fled and returned to the UCCP compound here after government soldiers occupied again their houses and the school and forced them to join the paramilitary group Alamara.</p>
<p>Residents who refuse to join the paramilitary were branded as supporters or members of the New People’s Army.</p>
<p>“What we wanted to discuss further are reasons why we have left our communities. About the military encampment and the forced recruitment by the paramilitary group,” Buntolan said.</p>
<p>“It was not discussed deeper,” Buntolan said about the hearing.</p>
<p>Hanimay Suazo, spokesperson of the human rights group Karapatan, said that “they [commissioners] were asking misleading questions which limits the resource persons.”</p>
<p>Suazo said the commissioners reiterated the issue on the “ideal protocols in evacuation centers” which, she said, was not the main issue.</p>
<p>“The point is that no one wants to evacuate, the main issue is on the militarization of the communities and schools,” Suazo said.</p>
<p>Suazo also said that commissioners “kept on raising the idea of separating Lumad evacuees into separate evacuation centers.”</p>
<p>Commissioner Roberto Cadiz, during the inquiry, suggested to the Lumad leaders and the support groups that “what if we (offer) another separate evacuation centers,” separating Lumads into different locations where “sanitation can be assured and government services can be accessible.”</p>
<p>Cadiz, in an interview with <em><a href="http://davaotoday.com/main/" target="_blank">Davao Today</a></em>, said that during their visit at the UCCP Haran, “they saw how crowded the 600 plus Lumads are in the area.”</p>
<p>But for Buntolan, he said that “they cannot allow it to happen.”</p>
<p>Buntolan said after the July 23 incident when police authorities accompanied by North Cotabato 2nd District Representative Nancy Catamco tried to “rescue” them, “it will not be ideal to separate us.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Cadiz explained that the first day of the public inquiry is “just to get the side of the Lumads and their support groups,” and on the next day would be inquiry on the side of the military, Rep. Catamco, the Department of Education, and other civil service organizations and government agencies concerned.</p>
<p>“Some of them have slightly different version of July 23. We want to listen to them,” Cadiz said.</p>
<p>As of now, Cadiz said that the CHR could still not make a conclusion on the public inquiry, but said they will come up with concrete recommendations to relevant agencies “after a month or two.”</p>
<p>“We come here with an open mind,” Cadiz said adding that after hearing the side of the other groups on Friday, Sept. 25, they “will make the report” on the inquiry.<strong>Reposted by</strong><em> <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></em></p>

Davao Today</strong></a></p>
<p>DAVAO CITY – The Office of the City Prosecutor here dismissed the case against 15 activists on allegations that they kidnapped and detained the Lumad evacuees in a church compound.</p>
<p>The resolution, dated September 8, said the case filed by some tribal leaders against the activists lacked sufficient evidence. The copy of the resolution received by<em> <a href="http://davaotoday.com/main/" target="_blank">Davao Today</a></em> indicates that the court ruling was received by the Ateneo Legal Services Center on Thursday.The resolution was signed by Prosecutor II Samuel Alencia and approved by City Prosecutor Nestor Ledesma.</p>
<p><a href="http://davaotoday.com/main/politics/cases-against-activists-lodged-after-ips-mass-evacuation/" target="_blank">The complaint with the docket number XI-02-INV-15-E-1848</a> was filed before the City Prosecutor’s Office against the activists in July for violation of Republic Act (RA) 267 or Kidnapping, Serious Illegal Detention and RA 9208 or the Anti-trafficking in persons Act of 2003 as amended by RA 10364 or the Expanded Anti-trafficking of Persons Act of 2012.</p>
<p>Included in the complaint were Rev. Jurie Jaime, Sheena Duazo, Hanimay Suazo, Ryan Lariba, Tony Salubre, Jimboy Marciano, Mary Ann Sapar, Jaja Necosia, Pedro Arnado, Kerlan Fanagel, Sr. Stella Matutina, Sr. Restita Miles, Isidro Indao, Kharlo Manano, Riuz Valle and many John Does.</p>
<p>The case was filed by members of the Matigsalug-Manobo tribe of Sitio Inayaman, Barangay San Jose, San Fernando Bukidnon namely Datu Kalumpot Dalon, Datu Larie Landahay, Libara Angkomog, Toto Angkomog, Juvnie Angkomog, Limar Mangomoy-at and Tata Angkomog-Lundia.</p>
<p>The complainants alleged that some time in January this year, they were promised free sacks of rice, grocery items, farm tools, among others, if they join an invitation to visit Davao City “to attend a dialogue with (President Benigno Aquino III, Mayor Rodrigo Duterte and Congressman Manny Pacquiao).” They said they were invited by one alias “Kumander Jose.”</p>
<p>The complainants said they and other IPs were then housed at the United Church of Christ in the Philippines Haran compound in Father Selga St., Davao City.</p>
<p>They said no free goods were given to them as promised and that they were made to join a rally in the Army camp in Panacan here.</p>
<p>The complainants said they were returned to their village in the mountains on February 26, 2015.They also said that they were prohibited from leaving the compound.</p>
<p>“On many occasions, the tribesmen decided to escape the compound, but they decided against it, because they have no fare money. They even admitted that one of them was able to escape the compound, but was caught at the Davao Terminal and brought back to the compound,” said the resolution.</p>
<p>However, it also said “(it) is essential in the crime of illegal detention that there be actual confinement or restriction of the person of the offended party.”</p>
<p>“Thus, if the alleged victim had freedom to leave the premises where she was allegedly confined, the crime of illegal detention cannot rise because she was not deprived of her liberty,” it said.</p>
<p>The resolution added that kidnapping would have been hard to conceal “since the UCCP Haran compound is right near Bankerohan Market. Kidnapping “en masse” in the heart of the city and confinement in a church compound is to say the least, not plausible.”</p>
<p>“It would have been hard not to notice this forced confinement. There were no armed guards to restrict their movement,” it said.</p>
<p>The resolution also defined trafficking in persons as “the exploitation or the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery, servitude, or the removal or sale of organs.”</p>
<p>“There is no prostitution, pornography, sexual exploitation, forced labor, slavery, involuntary servitude, debt bondage and armed activity,” the resolution said. <strong>Reposted by</strong><em> <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.nordis.net/2015/09/afp-atrocities-reminiscent-of-martial-law/" target="_blank"><strong>By KYLE EDWARD FRANCISCO<br />
Northern Dispatch Weekly</strong></a></p>
<p>VIGAN CITY, Ilocos Sur – “The Armed Forces of the Philippines’ only reputation is their propensity to violate human rights and terrorize the Filipino people.”</p>
<p>The statement was made by the Ilocos Human Rights Alliance (IHRA) in response to the Armed Forces of the Philippines claim that activists are only trying to tarnish its reputation in connection with the recent Lumad killings in Mindanao. IHRA said that under Aquino’s Oplan Bayanihan, the Armed Forces of the Philippines have literally turned communities in Ilocos Sur into garrisons, reminiscences of the martial law period.</p>
<p>The group scored the 7th Infantry Division of the Philippine Army for the continuing encampments in populated areas and human rights violations especially in peasant communities. Well-known for its bloody record, the army unit hugged the media and became notorious under the command of then General Jovito Palparan.</p>
<p>The 7th ID took over the region from the 5th ID in 2010 deploying the 3rd Infantry Battalion to cover the Ilocos provinces, La Union and Pangasinan except for the municipalities of San Emilio, Quirino and Cervantes that remained under the jurisdiction of the 50th Infantry Battalion of the 5th IDPA deployed in the tri-boundary of Benguet-Abra-Mt. Province-Ilocos Sur. In 2012, the 81st IBPA relieved the 3rd IBPA and took over the entire Ilocos Sur in 2014.</p>
<p>“Like the previous internal security plan, Oplan Bayanihan primarily aimed in suppressing dissent against the government with no differentiation between armed members of the revolutionary movement and civilians belonging to progressive organizations,” says Ma. Zoilo Baladad, Secretary General of IHRA.</p>
<p><strong>Extra-judicial killings</strong></p>
<p>Baladad also pointed out that justice remains elusive for the families and victims of extra-judicial killings (EJK) in the region. She cited the murder of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan Secretary-General Romy Sanchez and Pepe Manegdeg, Jr. of the Rural Missionaries of the Philippines. Suspected military agents killed Sanchez and Manegdeg in Baguio City in March 2005 and San Esteban in November 2006 respectively. Both fell victim to Gloria Macapagal’s Oplan Bantay Laya.</p>
<p>Under President Aquino’s Oplan Bayanihan, three individuals became victims of EJK. The group blames the armed state agents for the murder of Elmer Valdez, Nicolas Ramos and Carlo Magbulos.</p>
<p>Circumstantial evidence points to elements of the 50th and 86th Infantry Battalions for the September 2010 killing of Valdez and Ramos. The former is from Sta. Lucia and the latter from Salcedo both municipalities of Ilocos Sur. Both were found separately in shallow graves by residents who looked for them after they failed to come home during a military operation in the said municipalities.</p>
<p>Baladad narrated that upon learning of the people’s discovery of the graves, the army was quick to insinuate that both are members of the New People’s Army that were mortally wounded during an encounter in September 10 in Conconig East, Sta. Lucia.</p>
<p>“However, after residents and barangay officials confirmed that the two were civilians, the army changed their story and blamed the New People’s Army for supposedly taking Valdez as a human shield,” she added.</p>
<p>On October 29, 2012, five farmers were walking home from their farm work in Brgy. Cabuusan, Currimao when joint elements of the 81st IBPA, PNP Currimao and Regional Public Safety Battalion stationed in Banna, Ilocos Norte opened fire killing Magbulos and fatally wounding Ronald Sadaba. Three of their companions were able to run and take cover. They were shaken scared but were not wounded.</p>
<p>The PNP and army said that the victims were members of an armed group in the area. However, relatives, friends and barangay officials disputed their claim. Ironically, the four survivors from the attack are now facing charges and are only out on bail.</p>
<p><strong>Other human rights violations</strong></p>
<p>From 2012 to present, IHRA has documented two cases of physical assault and torture, 20 threat, harassment and intimidation, 10 illegal arrest and detention, and 10 filing of trumped-up charges with a total of 47 victims. All of these acts were committed by members of the 81st IBPA, most of which are in the Municipality of Sta. Cruz.</p>
<p>“Troops under the 7th ID do not respect the International Humanitarian Law, they encamped inside communities and public facilities, actions which are considered grave violations under the rules of war,” pointed Baladad.</p>
<p>She also noted the arrogance of the 81st IB fueled by the support of the local government of Sta. Cruz in putting their battalion headquarters near the houses in Brgy. Bugbuga. This, she added, is a blatant violation of Rule 23 of the Customary International Humanitarian Law and may constitute to a war crime. Baladad also said that the local government refuses to act on a petition signed and submitted by residents of Sta. Cruz expressing their protest against the army facility.</p>
<p><strong>Private armies for corporations</strong></p>
<p>In a separate statement, the revolutionary movement also scored the 81st IBPA for acting as private armies of foreign and local businesses, land grabbing of politicians and mining corporations.</p>
<p>Sadiri, Spokesperson of the Pambansang Katipunan ng Magbubukid (PKM)-Ilocos, said that elements of the 81st IBPA, the PNP’s Regional Public Safety Battalion and Provincial Public Safety Company are now stationed inside the residential areas of Brgy. San Antonio, Nagtengnga, Lalong, Pidpid, Amarao, San Pedro, Daligan, Quinfermin, Calaoaan, Camanggaan, San Jose, Banay and Coscosnong in Sta. Cruz.</p>
<p>Sadiri bared that Philip Morris Fortune Tobacco Corporation (PMFTC) provided for the materials and supplies for the battalion headquarters and is presently hosting a platoon of soldiers in their trading center in the town. He also said that last August, Vice Mayor Valle called a meeting to convince the farmers to enter into contract farming with the tobacco company.</p>
<p>“The installation of the army’s detachment and battalion headquarter in the area is to protect the land grabbing spree of Vice Mayor Virgilio Valle of Sta. Cruz for his eucalyptus plantation and for the furtherance of Philip Morris Fortune Tobacco Corporation’s (PMFTC) monopoly over the tobacco trade,” Sadiri added.</p>
<p>He urge the peasantry to strengthen their unity and support the New People’s Army to weaken and defeat the evil and oppressive triumvirate of the 81st IBPA, Vice Mayor Valle and PMFTC. <a href="http://www.nordis.net/">Northern Dispatch</a> <strong>Reposted by </strong><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://davaotoday.com/main/human-rights/baganis-are-for-peace-not-to-serve-your-interests-tribal-leader/" target="_blank"><strong>By JOHN RIZLE l. SALIGUMBA</strong></a></p>
<p>Davao Today</p>
<p>DAVAO CITY – A tribal leader is worried over the pronouncement by a congresswoman that she will file a bill to recognize and regulate the <em>bagani</em>, an indigenous defense system in the country.</p>
<p>“A <em>bagani</em> keeps peace and leads the people in defending the ancestral land. Baganis are also usually the <em>datus</em> (tribal leaders). They are not the paramilitary troops who are out to kill us, drive us away from our homes and facilitate the entry of outsiders,” said Datu Benito Bay-ao of the Manobos of Talaingod, Davao del Norte.</p>
<p>Bay-ao refers to the statement by North Cotabato Rep. Nancy Catamco, who posted in her Facebook account that “recognition should come explicitly by law, such as the law that regulates the services of private security agencies or the SCAA (Special Cafgu Active Auxiliary) as an auxiliary force to the Cafgu (Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit).”</p>
<p>The SCAA and Cafgu are paramilitary units or “force multipliers” under the command of the Philippine Army.</p>
<p>Bay-ao said that while their traditional bagani is for defense, the ones created by the Army, such as the group called Alamara “have been enticed with money and guns by the Army to hunt NPAs (New People’s Army).”</p>
<p>“This group together with the Army force us to join them or else we get branded as NPA supporters and get their ire. That is not what our bagani is all about,” he said.</p>
<p>Bay-ao said when an outsider like that of a logging company insisted to go deeper into their forests in the 1990s, their bagani Datu Guibang Apoga, called and consulted other datus to decide on their defense.</p>
<p>“Will the Alamara defend us if foreign loggers and miners pillage our ancestral land? Or will they be part of the clearing operations against us?” he said.</p>
<p>Bay-ao said, “Knowing Catamco, this is just a scheme to divide us, to use our traditional ways to make us fight against each other.”</p>
<p>“When she pushed us to go home even if we are not safe in our communities, she did not even recognize us as traditional Datus,” he said.</p>
<p>In a Facebook post, Catamco said the “indigenous community defense systems that have been in existence through all the years of collective and community life and history of these peoples is still practiced by many of our indigenous communities until today, except only for a few.”</p>
<p>Catamco said the IP “defense systems are living tradition amongst these peoples for the preservation and protection of their communities, their land and territory and all that is left of their cultural possession as peoples.”</p>
<p>She said these “defense systems” are still “less understood despite the clamor of many of these communities that it be categorically recognized in law as they believe is already recognized by IPRA (Indigenous People’s Rights Acts).”</p>
<p>Catamco said the IP defense systems “may be authorized by the appropriate government agency to exercise powers to prevent, apprehend and prosecute all persons violating environmental and natural resources laws within ancestral domains in accordance with Chapter XI, Section 72 of the IPRA.”</p>
<p>“On the other hand, I am equally aware of the many pitfalls that may lie ahead for the recognition of this right, and perhaps is the main reason why policy makers tend to have ignored its existence and the clamor for its recognition,” said Catamco.</p>
<p>However, she said ancestral domain(s) are “private and community property of the IPs concerned.”</p>
<p>Early September, forces from alleged indigenous paramilitary groups Magahat and Bagani killed a Lumad school administrator and two leaders in Diatagon village, Lianga in Surigo del Sur province.</p>
<p>Surigao del Sur Governor Johnny Pimentel said the tribal militias are “a monster created by the military.”</p>
<p>The Manobos in Diatagon have also left their villages in 2012 and in 2014.</p>
<p>In 2014, they signed an agreement with the local government that they will return home if their safety will be guaranteed from threats by the Bagani and Magahat, among other conditions.</p>
<p>“That is why no matter how the government force us to return home without guarantee to our safety, we will not go home. What happened in Surigao will certainly happen to us,” said Bay-ao.<strong>Reposted by</strong><em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a>)</em></p>

&#8220;We expect the Philippine government to immediately and thoroughly investigate the killings and the involvement of the AFP, and bring the perpetrators to justice.”</p>
<p><a href="http://davaotoday.com/main/human-rights/stopkillinglumads-belgian-ngo-wants-ph-govt-to-probe-army-involvement-in-ip-killings/" target="_blank"><strong>By ZEA IO MING C. CAPISTRANO<br />
Davao Today</strong></a></p>
<p>DAVAO CITY – An organization from Belgium has expressed its concern on the killings of Lumads in Mindanao and urges the government to investigate the involvement of soldiers.</p>
<p>The Belgian group, Solidagro wrote a letter on Sept. 8 to Ambassador Victoria Bataclan saying that the victims of the killings in Surigao del Sur last week were “related to the development support program” of the group.</p>
<p>Last September 1, school director of the Alternative Learning Center for Agricultural and Livelihood Development (Alcadev), Emerito Samarca was killed by suspected members of the Magahat Bagani Force inside the school compound. The Alcadev is one of the partners of Solidagro, said General Coordinator, Jan Vanhuysse.</p>
<p>Alcadev is an agricultural school for the indigenous students in the area, which won the Regional Literacy Contest in Caraga last year and ranked fifth in the National Literacy Award.</p>
<p>“Sadly, the emancipation of indigenous youth, resulting, amongst others, in their critical stand against destructive mining activities, is tackled with militarization, violence and repression,” said Vanhuysse.</p>
<p>Also killed during the attack of the militia group were community leader Dionel Campos who heads the Malahutayong Pakigbisog alang sa Sumusunod (Mapasu), and Datu Juvello Sinzo.</p>
<p>Vanhuysse also said they are expecting the government to act on the killings and investigate the alleged involvement of the Army.</p>
<p>“Although many of the earlier extrajudicial killings and disappearances in the Philippines have not been resolved until today, leading to a climate of impunity, we expect the Philippine government to immediately and thoroughly investigate the killings and the involvement of the AFP, and bring the perpetrators to justice,” said Vanhuysse.</p>
<p>Army officials have previously stated that they will also conduct their own investigation on the allegations that militias were seen inside Army camps in the area.</p>
<p>Capt. Alberto Caber had previously described what happened as “crimes in the community” which was a retaliation of one group against the other.</p>
<p>Caber said it is not true that they are supporting the tribal forces.</p>
<p>“There are groups and individuals who are anti-lawless groups, anti-communists. But if you are anti, are you immediately (supported) by the military? No,” said Caber in an interview with <em>Davao Today</em>.</p>
<p>Caber said Army commanders can only command government troops under their command.</p>
<p>One of the witnesses, Josephine Pagalan, spokesperson of Kahugpungan sa mga Lumadnong Organisasyon (Unity of Lumad Organizations), in an interview with <em>Davao Today</em> said that on August 30, members of the Army arrived first in their area even before the Magahat forces came.</p>
<p>Pagalan said the military “cannot deny their involvement in the atrocities.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Vanhuysse also appealed to the Philippine Ambassador to “ensure the safety of our staff and that of our partner organizations in your country.”</p>
<p>Vanhuysse said they have also sent letters to the Belgian Foreign Affairs Department, the Belgian Embassy in Manila and the European Union representation in Manila.</p>
<p>Solidagro has been working with Philippine NGOs for more than three decades. Vanhuysse said they implement “a food security program, funded by the Belgian government (DGD), in the Cordillera, Masbate, Samar and the Caraga region.” <strong><em>Reposted by</em></strong> <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>
