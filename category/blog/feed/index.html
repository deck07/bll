				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">MANILA &#8212; Environment group Kalikasan People’s Network for the Environment warned against &#8220;a possible conflict of interest&#8221; in San Miguel Corporation’s (SMC) recent P1-billion partnership with the Department of the Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). The green group likens it to a ‘soft payment’ to induce the government agency to fast track reclamation projects of SMC in Manila Bay.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“San Miguel’s P1-billion rehab is highly suspicious because it comes alongside its push for its Aerotropolis and Expressway-Dike reclamation projects across Northern Manila Bay,&#8221; said Leon Dulce, National Coordinator, Kalikasan People’s Network for the Environment (Kalikasan PNE).</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_106722" style="width: 735px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-106722" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bulacan_aerotropolis_direct_hit_onMap.jpg" alt="reclamation of Bulacan coasts" width="735" height="549" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bulacan_aerotropolis_direct_hit_onMap.jpg 735w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/bulacan_aerotropolis_direct_hit_onMap-489x365.jpg 489w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bulakan fishing villages/areas to be &#8220;direct hit&#8221; of planned reclamation to pave way for San Miguel Corporations&#8217; airport, real estate, infrastructure projects (map lifted from Silvertides&#8217; presentation during a &#8220;public hearing&#8221; in an evacuation center in Bulakan, Feb 4, 2018.)</figcaption></figure><br />
SMC President and Chief Operating Officer Ramon S. Ang signed on March 4 a five-year agreement with DENR for a comprehensive dredging and clean-up program for the 59.25 kilometer Tullahan River.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We fear that it might serve as ‘greenwashing’ to cover up for SMC&#8217;s destructive projects, at best, or grease money for the railroading of reclamation at worst,” said Dulce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Since last year SMC is processing government  approval of its proposal to develop a 2,500-hectare Aerotropolis in Bulacan province worth P700 Billion. It also has a pending public-private partnership proposal, the Manila Bay Integrated Flood Control and Coastal Defense and Expressway Project, an expressway-dike which covers 18,000 hectares across the northern part of Manila Bay.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Kalikasan PNE said Silvertides Holdings Corporation, SMC’s contractor company for land acquisition, is suspected as responsible for clearing at least 657 mangrove trees in Bulakan municipality without securing an Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) and special tree cutting permit. The company recently claimed it will leave the existing 24.5-hectare mangrove eco-park in Bulakan undisturbed with the proposed construction of the Aerotropolis.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s easy to claim that the Aerotropolis will not affect mangrove parks and forests in Manila Bay but studies show otherwise. An ecosystem valuation case study in Manila Bay revealed how a land reclamation project complete with ecosystem conservation, buffering, and rehabilitation efforts could only generate only up to 49 percent of the area’s original ecosystem services,” explained Dulce.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The environmental group challenged the SMC to prove its sincerity in contributing to the rehabilitation of Manila Bay &#8220;by desisting their reclamation projects in Bulacan.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“SMC’s P1-billion is chump change compared to the degree of environment destruction, loss of livelihood, and disaster risks that the Aerotropolis and the Expressway-Dike will cause in communities along Manila Bay” Dulce said.<a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<blockquote><p><strong> </strong>“If anyone had rights over the Manila Bay, it is the Filipino people, and if it is to serve any purpose, it should be for the benefit of the general population, and not an elite few.” &#8212; Makabayan lawmakers</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>By MARYA SALAMAT</strong><br />
<em><a href="http://bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA &#8212; Bucking threats from local government leaders and intermittent military “visibility” in their communities, members of the fisherfolk communities in Bulacan have <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/10/16/planned-bulacan-aerotropolis-to-bring-perpetual-hunger-fisherfolk/">protested the proposed reclamation </a>affecting their homes and fishing grounds. “Buo sa isip ko, kaya namin lumaban (I&#8217;m entirely sure in my mind that we can oppose this),” fisherwoman and spokesperson of Network Opposed to Reclamation in Bulacan Monica Anastacio, 63, told <em>Bulatlat</em> in Filipino.</p>
<p>They have questioned since last year what they considered as initial steps to reclamation, the massive cutting of mangrove trees serving San Miguel Corporation’s proposal to do away with their communities and build an international airport on today’s river and villages. Despite the <a href="http://conceptnewscentral.com/index.php/2018/04/16/anti-bulakan-airport-folks-not-a-joke-to-pile-soil-on-our-fishponds/">support to this project</a> by their local government officials, they organized a Network Opposed to the Aerotropolis and Reclamation in Bulacan on October 2018.</p>
<p>With support of their fishermen, the women comprised the network’s unanimous choice as spokespersons to help convene the rest of the affected villagers for the defense of the bay, and to represent them as well in dialogues or forum in the mainland. They launched the campaign to #SaveTaliptip in early 2018.</p>
<p>Supported by the multisectoral Alyansa para sa Pagtatanggol ng Kabuhayan, Paninirahan at Kalikasan sa Manila Bay (AKAP KA-Manila Bay), the Bulacan fisherfolk launched a petition against reclamation since late 2018.  They sent delegations to various pickets and dialogues held at the national headquarters of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). They spoke at peoples’ conferences on climate change, on land use and food security.</p>
<p>“<em>Malaking kawalan sa lahat pag pumayag tayo tabunan,</em>” (It will be a huge loss for everyone if we agree to reclamation) a priest from the Bulacan Ecumenical Forum who grew up catching fish and seafood in Taliptip told a gathering of residents in Taliptip.</p>

Salamat / Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The communities in Taliptip are united not just in protecting the mangroves but also in opposing moves to displace the fisherfolk in favor of a private company’s reclamation, according to Monica Anastacio, a resident of Taliptip for over 50 years. To them it is not just a call for saving their homes or sources of livelihoods for themselves. They believe other Filipinos in the mainland also stand to lose when the mangroves and the relatively affordable sources of nutritious fish and seafood are buried under concrete.</p>
<p>She has worked with her family in Taliptip saltbeds since she was in grade school. When the salt farms stopped operation in 1990s, she and her husband turned to fishing. The women in these coastal communities are used to working with their husbands, from the saltfarms of decades ago to today’s fishing.</p>

<p>While fishing is traditionally a male occupation in the Philippines, it is not uncommon to see women at work, too, setting traps (for crabs), casting nets, rowing the family’s banca, or selling the fish catch. Some women also go down to the river or out on the bay to catch fish. Some wade into the muddy, shallow loam to catch crabs. These days they add to their responsibilities of taking care of their household and family various tasks toward network-building to turn the rehabilitation of river and the bay to the people’s favor.</p>
<p>Their background of being saltfarmers and fisherfolk speaks of how much food the areas where they live now have contributed and could further contribute to the country’s food needs.</p>
<p>The coastal communities in Bulakan were <a href="http://www.map-abcdf.com.ph/documents/presentations/Agribusiness/Agricultural%20Activities%20and%20Services/06%20Philippine%20Salt%20Industry.pdf">major contributors to the country’s salt sufficiency f</a>or decades. Until 1990s, Bulacan was producing more than a hundred metric tons of salt, equivalent to more than half the country&#8217;s needs. That is, until a combination of the impact of climate change and trade liberalization began eroding the industry to a pale shadow of itself at present. Nowadays, the fisherfolk group Pamalakaya says the government’s approval of reclamation projects also threatens the country’s food security, along with other policies that ultimately shrink the fishing grounds and mangroves and remove the fisherfolk from the coasts.</p>
<p>Facing the threat of displacement due to reclamation, the women of Bulakan are facilitating their organizing and network formation for an organized response. Now they are also finding time to ride their bancas and visit their neighboring fishing communities in hopes of strengthening their network opposing the reclamation of their coastal villages.</p>
<p>Asked why it is the women frequently being sent to represent the fisherfolk in outside forum and dialogues, they replied that the menfolk are working with them and supportive, but the tasks of representation can be squeezed along with their other duties such as taking care of the household, selling the fish catch and procuring supplies.</p>
<p><strong>Threats Not only in Bulacan but along entire Manila Bay</strong></p>
<p>What is threatening to happen in Bulakan and neighboring coastal towns is happening under similar projects around the Philippines, said Jam Pinpin, spokesperson of Pamalakaya.</p>
<p>A total of 43 reclamation projects covering more than 32, 000 hectares are pending throughout the 194, 400-hectare Manila Bay, based on record obtained by Pamalakaya from the Philippine Reclamation Authority (PRA).</p>
<p>In Bulacan the SMC has won over the local government executives. Even as it has yet to conclude a concession agreement with the government (for the proposed airport), its subcontractors are already at work readying the ground for reclamation.  It is now at the final stages in the process of securing an ECC (Environmental Compliance Certificate) that will pave the way to reclamation of over 2,500 hectares. It was suspected to have been behind the massive cutting of old-growth mangroves in April 2018. This month as we write, the residents of nearby villages of Obando posted in Save Taliptip’s social media account that strangers were knocking on their doors asking them the sizes of their house and telling them they will have to leave soon.</p>
<p>In Manila, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) announced last week it will start  dredging in the Baywalk area of the Roxas Boulevard in March, saying it is part of the ongoing rehabilitation drive of Manila Bay.</p>
<p>But national fisherfolk group Pamalakaya warned that the targeted area for dredging also happens to be the area where the 148-hectare Manila Solar City reclamation project that will occupy 3.5 kilometers of Manila Bay’s shoreline will be located.</p>
<p>It brings a bitter déjà vu to the fisherfolk leader. He recalled that shortly before the SM Mall of Asia and Entertainment City establishments in Roxas Boulevard began construction years before, there was also some dredging work that resulted to the displacement of more than 6,000 fishing and urban poor families.</p>
<p>In Cavite, a province south of Manila, the coastal villages of mainly fisherfolk are also in a constant battle to save their community and livelihood. At least four reclamation projects covering hundreds to thousands of hectares of Cavite coastlines are being processed by the Philippine Reclamation Authority.</p>
<p>Unlike in Bulacan where the Manila Bay is still bounded by an expanse of alternating shallow loam/islets, a network of rivers and patches of mangroves, in Cavite, only a thin stretch of the shore remains between the bank that has been cemented for road and real estate development and the Manila Bay. Living on what’s left of this narrow shore the fisherfolk communities organized under Pamalakaya have been protesting reclamation and their demolition. They have suffered at least four incidences of suspected <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2017/04/08/fisherfolk-urban-poor-suspect-deliberate-burning-community/">arson</a>.</p>

<p>In advancing their defense of the bay, they pointed to documents from the government’s Environmental Management Bureau (EMB) itself state that the reclamation projects will have ecological impacts in Manila Bay.</p>
<p>It says that throughout the construction of the various projects, contaminants from dredged sediments will be released, deplete dissolved oxygen, and destroy natural habitats of sardines and mangroves found in Manila Bay.  Once finished, the projects will interfere with the natural tide flow of water in the area and erode the shoreline of nearby beaches. The erosion could cause flooding in nearby low-lying areas especially during a typhoon.</p>
<p>Worse flooding has also been recorded in coastal towns of Bulacan since the reclamation of Manila Bay. The fisherfolk group Pamalakaya urged the government to take heed of its own environmental bureau’s assessment.</p>
<p>Based on the assessment of environmentalists and fisherfolk, the government’s ‘Battle for Manila Bay’ is turning out to be another mock battle for rehabilitation.</p>
<p>“With the recent actions of administration such as justifying reclamation projects and the abrupt issuance of Executive Order 74, or the taking over of the power to approve such projects and command of the Philippine Reclamation Authority (PRA), &#8220;Manila Bay rehabilitation&#8221; is becoming synonymous to &#8220;Manila Bay reclamation,&#8221; said Anakpawis party-list Rep. Ariel Casilao.</p>

<p>Environment Secretary Frank Cimatu denied this just this week. But around the same time he was saying these to reporters, Manila Mayor Joseph Estrada was defending and even extolling the reclamation projects.</p>
<p>Anakpawis’ Casilao said all these are a serving as a challenge for the people to advance a genuine rehabilitation of Manila Bay.</p>
<p>“If anyone had rights over the Manila Bay, it is the Filipino people, and if it is to serve any purpose, it should be for the benefit of the general population, and not an elite few,” read a part of the explanatory note when the Makabayan bloc of partylist lawmakers filed this February 7 the <a href="http://congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/basic_17/HB09067.pdf">House Bill 9067 declaring Manila Bay as Reclamation-free Zone</a>.</p>
<p>The proposed law criticized not only the <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2019/01/20/environmentalists-fisherfolk-denounce-denrs-fake-rehabilitation-of-manila-bay/">duplicity in the Duterte administration’s conduct of “rehabilitating” Manila Bay</a> – Anakpawis Partylist said it’s just a façade for facilitating reclamation and taking the bay away from the people. After years of previous reclamation, the ordinary people’s access now to the famed Manila Bay has been reduced to a few kilometers near Rajah Sulayman – and even there the poor are banned from swimming.</p>
<p>In Cavite, Pamalakaya’s Hicap rued said what used to be miles of cheap sources of clams and mussels are now concrete roads that could have been built elsewhere.</p>
<p>Makabayan lawmakers from Anakpawis, Bayan Muna, Gabriela, ACT and Kabataan Partylist traced how, through years of previous reclamation, “Development” along Manila Bay, has wiped out the mangrove ecosystem, from as broad as 54,000 hectares at the turn of the 20th century, to a measly 794 hectares in 1995.</p>

Salamat / Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure>
<p>“Companies destroy mangroves because they saw no profit in maintaining it,” the Makabayan lawmakers said. And after reclamation the ordinary citizens also lose access to what remains of the bay.</p>
<p>“It is as clear as the blue sky of Manila Bay’s horizon that reclamation has deprived the people of public access,” Makabayan said in seeking to declare Manila Bay as reclamation-free zone.</p>
<p>Last February 22, a broad alliance and watchdog for genuine rehabilitation and against reclamation projects was launched in Malate Church near the last remaining free baywalk in Manila Bay. The watchdog seeks to garner support to declaring Manila Bay as a &#8220;reclamation-free&#8221; zone.</p>
<p>They hope that with the proposed law in Congress and the people’s movement and campaigns, they can refute any ruse of any group or even by the government “that worships profit at the cost of undermining the people’s aspiration for a sincerely-rehabilitated, restored and preserved Manila Bay. <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>MANILA – A theatre worker was arrested by combined members of the Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team and the police in Guindulman, Bohol on Monday, March 4.</p>
<p>Alvin Fortaliza, artistic director of the Bol-anong Artista nga may Diwang Dagohoy (Bansiwag) Bohol Cultural Network was reportedly accosted by the authorities while campaigning for Anakpawis Party-list at Guindulman town market and was immediately brought to detention. Fortaliza was among the names listed in a warrant of arrest for the charge of murder.</p>
<p>The Concerned Artists of the Philippines (CAP) condemned the arrest of Fortaliza saying that artists who are critical of President Duterte’s administration are not spared from being arrested.</p>
<p>“Fortaliza’s arrest happened after the harassment and killings of progressive party-list campaigners in the Visayas region. But this also points to a disturbing shift in the attacks against artists and cultural workers,” the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>According to Humabol, a peasant group in Bohol, Fortaliza was known for his socially relevant performances in and outside the province. His performances depict the lives and aspirations of poor farmers, workers, youth, women and other marginalized sectors. He also conducts theater workshops for youth groups around Central Visayas.</p>
<p>Fortaliza is also a volunteer of Anakpawis Party-list and actively help in its campaign.</p>
<p>&#8220;He believes that aside from using arts which he is good at, to amplify people&#8217;s calls, electing officials who truly represent the marginalized in Congress is also another way of advancing their rightful demands like genuine agrarian reform. For this, he untiringly campaigned for Anakpawis Partylist. And while doing this, he was arrested,” the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>The group said that Fortaliza’s arrest brought about by false charges against him are meant to harass, demonize and silence activists who are critical of the government’s policies such as Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) Law and Rice Tarrification Law which was recently signed by President Duterte.</p>
<p>“This is also what they did to Nelson Lumantas, Humabol deputy secretary general, who was slapped with poorly concocted murder charges December last year, over an incident that happened almost 20 years ago,” the group said.</p>
<p>Anakpawis Rep. Ariel Casilao demands for the release of Fortaliza. He also said that they will formally inform the Commission on Elections (Comelec) of the harassments and killing of their leaders and members by the state forces. Just recently, a leader of Anakpawis was killed in Pangasinan. Robert Mejia, a leader of Anakpawis and vice president of Bayambang Farmers Association was shot dead on Feb. 19 in Tayug, Pangasinan.</p>
<p>“Activists are not criminals; the criminals are the plunderers, mass murderers, allied with the administration,” said Casilao.</p>
<p>“Why the Duterte regime is targeting artists and cultural workers at this point is clear. A government that is kept afloat by bullying, cover ups, deceit, fake news, falsehoods, red-tagging, rights violations, fascist repression, silence, whitewashing, and organized trolling can only be threatened by art’s potential to speak truth to power and to help unite more people towards collective action,” CAP said in a statement.</p>
<p>The group calls on their fellow artists to support the call for the immediate release of Fortaliza. “Let us not wait for any more of our colleagues from the art and cultural sector to be arrested, assaulted, killed, or disappeared amidst the rising attacks. Let us stand for freedom of expression, human rights, and justice to prevent another dictatorship from rising to power.” <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>MANILA- Indigenous people, women, and youth groups marched to various government offices on Tuesday to condemn the extension of Martial Law and the US military intervention in the country.    </p>
<p>According to a statement from Save Our Schools, the decision of the Supreme Court is a blatant disregard of its mandate of protecting the interest of the Lumad people and their communities. Students from Mindanao wrote letters addressed to the Supreme Court justices stating their “anger and disappointment” over the decision.</p>
<p>Apart from the Supreme Court, members of Save Our Schools Mindanao, Kasalo-CARAGA and other Mindanao-based organizations also held protest actions before the Department of Justice and the United States embassy, where they assailed its role in human rights abuses.</p>

<p>“US Aggression in this new millennium is embodied by Martial Law in Mindanao, counter-insurgency programs such as Oplan Kapayapaan, and the bloody Oplan Tokhang,” said  League of Filipino Student chairperson Kara Tagaoa.</p>
<p>Tagaoa also criticized lopsided deals with the United States such as the Mutual Defense Treaty, the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, the Mutual Logistics Support Agreement, and the Visiting Forces Agreement as new forms of colonial imposition of US interest over Philippines.</p>
<p>Groups will march again on March 8 during International Women’s Day celebration at Mendiola, Liwasang Bonifacio and Luneta.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Konteksto</strong><br />
<strong> Ni DANILO ARAÑA ARAO</strong></p>
<p>Naniniwala ka pa bang mas mababa ang kinikita ng kababaihan kumpara sa kalalakihan?</p>
<p>Ayon sa <a href="https://www.payscale.com/data/gender-pay-gap">pinakahuling pag-aaral ng PayScale</a> tungkol sa kaibahan ng sahod ayon sa kasarian (gender pay gap), nakakakuha lang ng US$0.78 ang babae sa bawat US$1.00 na kinikita ng lalaki. At sa isang sitwasyon daw na ang babae’t lalaki ay may parehong kwalipikasyon tulad ng antas ng edukasyon at karanasan, nagiging US$0.98 sa bawat US$1.00 ang kaibahan.</p>
<p>Kung ganito ang sitwasyon sa pandaigdigang antas, ano naman ang kalagayan ng kababaihan sa Pilipinas? Kung pagbabatayan ang <a href="https://psa.gov.ph/sites/default/files/2019 FactSheet Women and Men_as of 01Mar2019%28prelim%29.xlsx">Women and Men FactSheet 2019</a> mula sa Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA), may dahilan ba para magbunyi ang kababaihan sa usapin ng sahod?</p>
<p>Ang average na taunang kinikita raw kasi ng babaeng tagapagtaguyod ng pamilya (household head) ay P284 kumpara sa lalaking “household head” na P262. Oo, mataas nga pero tandaan nating ito ang kinikita sa bawat taon. Kung paniniwalaan ang datos ng PSA na kinuha mula sa Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES) noong 2015, nangangahulugang kumikita lang ng P10.92 ang babae at P10.08 ang lalaki bawat buwan (kung ang kanyang pagtatrabaho ay 26 na araw).</p>
<p>Medyo mataas nga ang kita ng babae kumpara sa lalaki, pero malinaw na kulang pang pambili ng bigas ang kita sa isang araw. Sadyang walang pinipiling kasarian ang mababang sahod sa Pilipinas.</p>
<p>Pero hindi lang naman usapin ng sahod ang kinakaharap ng babae sa kasalukuyan. Sa konteksto ng kasalukuyang kampanya ng mga kandidato at party-list group para sa halalang mangyayari sa Mayo 13, mainam na suriin ang mga nahalal na mga opisyal sa mga eleksiyong nagdaan. <em>(Tingnan ang Talahanayan)</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/danny-table.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106771" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/danny-table.png" alt="" width="728" height="342" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/danny-table.png 728w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/danny-table-660x310.png 660w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></a></p>
<p>Kumpara sa eleksiyon noong 1998, kapansin-pansin ang unti-unting pagtaas ng bilang ng mga babaeng nahahalal sa puwesto. Kung sabagay, hindi na ito nakakagulat dahil nagkaroon na tayo ng dalawang Presidenteng babae. Babae rin naman ang kasalukuyang Bise Presidente, hindi ba? Pero malinaw sa datos na ang bilang ng mga babaeng nahalal na opisyal ay isa lamang sa bawat lima. Sa madaling salita, nananatili sila sa napakaliit na minorya.</p>
<p>Madaling sabihing ang solusyon sa ganitong problema ay pataasin pa ang sahod ng kababaihan at paramihin pa ang bilang ng mahahalal sa puwesto sa mga darating pang eleksiyon tulad ng mangyayari sa Mayo 13. Pero halimbawa lang na mangyari ang mga ito, may maaasahan bang pagbabago ang kababaihan?</p>
<p>Nariyan pa rin kasi ang itinakdang papel ng lipunan sa babae bilang diumanong “ilaw ng tahanan” na dapat na nag-aalaga ng anak at asawa. Siya pa rin ang inaasahang gumawa ng mga gawaing bahay tulad ng pagluluto, paglalaba, pagpaplantsa at paglilinis ng bahay para siguraduhing komportable ang lalaking diumanong “haligi ng tahanan” sa kanyang pag-uwi. Sa isang sitwasyong kailangang magtrabaho ang parehong mag-asawa, hindi nababawasan ang pasanin ng babae. Siya pa nga ang nasisisi kung hindi napagkakasya sa araw-araw na gastusin ang pinagsamang kakarampot na kinikita nila.</p>
<p>Opo, babalik at babalik pa rin tayo sa tinatawag na patriyarkal na sistema ng lipunang nagbubunsod ng maling kaisipan hinggil sa papel ng babae sa lipunan. Sa kabila ng retorika ng mas magandang katayuan ng babae sa kasalukuyan kumpara sa nakaraan, kailangang huwag lang matali sa estadistika dahil kailangang suriin ang konteksto ng pinagdaraanan niya. Kapansin-pansin nga ang pagbabago sa kantidad (quantitative change), pero paano na lang ang pagbabago sa kalidad (qualitative change)?</p>
<p>Gugunitain ang International Women’s Day sa Marso 8. Sinimulan ng United Nations (UN) ang taunang komemorasyon noong 1975. Bakit Marso 8? Ito kasi ang araw na nag-aklas ang kababaihan ng Rusya noong 1917 sa kalagitnaan ng Unang Digmaang Pandaigdig. Ang kanilang kolektibong panawagan noon ay tinapay at kapayapaan (“<a href="http://www.un.org/en/events/womensday/history.shtml">Bread and Peace</a>”). Ilang araw pagkatapos ng kanilang kilos-protesta, nag-abdicate ang Czar at ang pumalit na gobyerno ay binigyan ang kababaihan ng karapatang bumoto.</p>
<p>Kung may aral tayong dapat makuha sa kasaysayan ng pagkilos ng kababaihan, ito ay ang malinaw na progresibong pinagmulan ng Marso 8. Mainam na ipagpatuloy ang tradisyon ng kolektibong pagkilos ng kababaihan para sa pagbabagong nais makamtan.</p>

<p><strong>By MARA S. GENOTIVA</strong><br />
<em><a href="http://davaotoday.com/">Davao Today</a></em></p>
<p>DAVAO CITY, Philippines – Bayan Muna Party-list raised alarm over “highly unusual” loan agreement between the Philippines and China saying it is a “threat to national security.”</p>
<p>Neri Colmenares, Makabayan’s senatorial bet, was referring to the P3.6 billion loan agreement for the Chico River River Pump Irrigation Project.</p>
<p>It was signed by Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of China Zhao Jianhua on behalf of the Export-Import Bank of China and Department of Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez last April 10, 2018.</p>
<p>Colmenares warned that the said agreement is highly unusual as it allows China to “take over” the country’s ports, airports, and even energy resources “in case of default.</p>
<p>Section 8.1 of the agreement, particularly on “Waiver of Immunity” states that the Philippines “irrevocably waives any immunity” of its patrimonial assets and assets which are for commercial use.</p>
<p>“This means that government properties such as the Batangas ports or any of our ports for that matter, or energy assets of the Power Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corporation (PSALM) or Napocor (National Power Corporation), even the LRT and MRT, can be taken over by China in case we fail to pay these hundreds of billions in Chinese loans,” Colmenares said.</p>
<p>Colmenares recalled the case of Sri Lanka in 2017 when it turned over Hambantota port for a 99-year lease to China Merchants Port Holdings Company, a government-owned company, after struggling to pay its debt amounting to more than $8 billion.</p>
<p>He added that this provision cannot be found in loan agreements of the Philippines with other countries.</p>
<p>“China, which has been gobbling up our territories in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) is now being allowed by our very own government to gobble up our territories and public facilities in the mainland. This very unusual agreement violates our Constitution, is a threat to national security and must be voided.”</p>
<p>Another red flag, Colmenares noted, is the requirement being asked from the Department of (DOJ) for the issuance of a certification stipulating that the agreement is constitutional.</p>
<p>With such certification, he pointed out that no one could question the constitutionality of the said agreement in Philippine courts.</p>
<p>He added that the Department of Finance (DOF) has also agreed that any dispute related to the agreement will be filed in a Chinese arbitration body in Beijing using China’s law.</p>
<p>This is contrary to the loan agreements the country has entered into with other countries where both parties agree to follow the international arbitration rules.</p>
<p><em>“Sa ilalim ng loan agreement na ito, pag may dispute tayo with China dun tayo mag file sa arbitration court nila kung saan malamang talo tayo,pero yung panalo natin sa international arbitral tribunal on the West Philippine Sea ay binabale wala nila. Katusuhan yon kasi gusto ng China lagi silang panalo,”</em> he added.</p>
<p>DOF Assistant Secretary Antonio Lambino shrugged off Bayan Muna’s claims saying the agreement was carefully evaluated by the Investment Coordination Committee (ICC), which is composed of the Department of Justice, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the DOF.</p>
<p>In response to Lambino, Colmenares noted: “If the agreement was really vetted as the DOF claims, why did it sign an agreement so lopsided in favor of China containing conditions which are not imposed by other creditor countries and institutions?”</p>
<p>Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate also questioned the confidentiality clause of the agreement which deprived the public of information about the said loan.</p>
<p>Section 8.8 of the agreement states that the Philippines “shall keep all the terms, conditions and the standard fees hereunder or in connection with this Agreement.”</p>
<p><em>“Tayo ang magbabayad ng loan na ito, bakit itatatago sa atin?</em> Our loans with ADB are posted on their website while China’s loans cannot be accessed by the people who will pay for it. This is a deviation from standard international practice,” said Zarate.</p>
<p>Colmenares also slammed DOF’s statement as mere justification to cover up the onerous nature of the said loan agreement.</p>
<p>“The main issue here is that the Philippine government has allowed China to dictate the terms of these loans,” Colmenares said. <strong><em>Reposted by</em></strong> <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bu-op-icons-luis.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-72027" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bu-op-icons-luis.jpg" alt="" width="130" height="170" /></a> His spokesperson Salvador Panelo insisted that it wasn’t because President Rodrigo Duterte thinks that the 1986 civilian-military mutiny at EDSA isn’t important; it’s just that he has a lot of things to do.</p>
<p>Panelo announced Mr. Duterte’s non-attendance at the February 25 official commemoration of the 33rd anniversary of that event days earlier. That made the claim that “he has a lot of things to do” sound like one more lame excuse in the Palace’s lengthening list of such other excuses as “he was tired,” to explain his absence in a meeting of ASEAN heads of states; that he was “resting” during the three days he didn’t attend any official function; or that he suddenly flew to Hong Kong “to go shopping.” But what made it really look like a deliberate snub is that he has never graced that occasion, his failure to do so this year being his third since 2017.</p>
<p>One can only conclude that Mr. Duterte has a dim view of the February 22-25 events at EDSA, most probably because they led to the overthrow of the Marcos kleptocracy. Like his mercenary keyboard army of trolls and hacks in print and broadcast, he probably thinks that only the Aquinos gained anything from EDSA 1, and that it removed from power a decisive man of action whose clever use of the police and military to advance his and his family’s political and economic interests deserves emulation rather than history’s condemnation.</p>
<p>Mr. Duterte has not only expressed his admiration for this country’s first and hopefully last tin-horn version of Adolf Hitler (whose “decisiveness” in murdering six million Jews he once admitted he admires). He has also demonstrated it in at least three ways. There was his decision to allow the burial of the earthly remains of the far from heroic Ferdinand Marcos, Sr. in the country’s Libingan ng mga Bayani. (Heroes’ Cemetery). There is also his ill-concealed support for Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, Jr.’s electoral protest. Add to that his outright declaration that despite the Constitution, he prefers Marcos, Jr. over Vice-President Leni Robredo to succeed him should he resign the presidency.</p>
<p>To explain Mr. Duterte’s unashamed pandering to Marcos interests, some observers say it’s because Ilocos Norte Governor Imee Marcos, who’s currently running for senator, was one of the few local government officials to support his candidacy for president of this unfortunate Republic. But it’s likely to be due not only to the Marcoses’ financial and other forms of support in 2016. What’s even more disturbing is that it might be because of his own belief that he’s entitled to the same unaccountable abuse of power that Marcos exercised by declaring martial law in 1972.</p>
<p>Once a petty provincial despot whose powers were so unchecked they included, by his own admission, support for, if not command over a death squad, Mr. Duterte has since demonstrated his contempt for the system of checks and balances mandated by the Constitution as well as for free expression and the independent press vital to democratic governance.</p>
<p>As distressing as that may already be, the opinion polls have since found that many Filipinos share, if not Mr. Duterte’s sense of entitlement, at least his fascination with dictatorship as the path to the solution of this country’s legions of problems.</p>
<p>That fascination is founded as much on the obvious failures of what passes for democracy in these isles of illusions as on the far too common and totally baseless, fact-challenged belief that the Marcos dictatorship was a period of peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>By encouraging EDSA 1’s being labeled a “revolution,” with all the promise in that description of political and economic democratization and of ending the poverty, social inequality and mass misery that have long haunted this country’s long-suffering people, the leading figures of EDSA 1 — Corazon Aquino, Jaime Cardinal Sin, Fidel Ramos, Juan Ponce Enrile — were at least partly responsible for the perception that what had replaced the Marcos tyranny was democratic rule.</p>
<p>It was no such thing. EDSA 1 made possible the return to power of the wing of the political class that Marcos had targeted for exclusion through Presidential Decree 1081. It reestablished the limited, elite democracy that had been in place since Commonwealth days, rather than install a government run by the majority. EDSA enabled the land-based faction of the ruling political elite to overthrow one-man rule, and to repeal Marcos’s most repressive laws. Both were necessary for the country to move forward, but that was about all it did.</p>
<p>Restored by EDSA 1, the rule of the land-based, old-rich was saddled with such remnants of the past regime as Enrile and Ramos, who eventually gained even more power and in fact allowed the return of <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/02_25_19-martin-Edsa-happenings.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-106605 alignright" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/02_25_19-martin-Edsa-happenings-299x365.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="365" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/02_25_19-martin-Edsa-happenings-299x365.jpg 299w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/02_25_19-martin-Edsa-happenings-768x939.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/02_25_19-martin-Edsa-happenings-687x840.jpg 687w" sizes="(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px" /></a>the Marcoses and their allies not only to the country in a literal sense, but also to government.</p>
<p>Not only in the ensuing years after EDSA 1 were the promises of that “revolution” unfulfilled. Very early on, for example, despite such sound advice as that of the United States Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Roy Prosterman for President Corazon Cojuangco Aquino to use her legislative powers to decisively address the land issue before Congress reconvened, or else risk civil war, the latter balked and relied on the landlord-dominated Congress to later pass a land reform law so full of loopholes it became practically meaningless.</p>
<p>Mrs. Aquino’s reluctance to outrightly abolish the Philippines’ centuries-old land tenancy system — “the worst on the planet,” according to Prosterman — wasn’t entirely due to her fears of abusing her pre-1987 “revolutionary” powers. Subsequent versions of land reform allowed the conversion of agricultural lands into industrial estates, which is what the Cojuangcos did to their own Hacienda Luisita.</p>
<p>The twin imperatives of authentic land reform and industrial development — policies at the heart of the development of Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan among others — succeeding regimes belittled and ignored, and at one point even described (during the Benigno Aquino III administration) as “old hat.” Instead, it is the decades-long policy of encouraging foreign investments that has remained in place despite its demonstrated shortcomings.</p>
<p>The consequences are there for all to see: the persistence of poverty and hunger despite economic growth and, consequently, the desperate search for a solution among the country’s impoverished and powerless millions. Every election period, they are nevertheless deceived into electing to office the same dynasts and their allies whose only program is to advance their self, familial and class interests and to kowtow to whatever foreign power is willing to support their continuing dominance over the politics and government of this neo-colony..</p>
<p>What is outrageous is that it is those very dynasts who are responsible for the country’s being the basket case of Southeast Asia. Their incompetent, corrupt, and self-aggrandizing governance has been a total failure. But they blame the democracy they’ve been sabotaging for decades for the consequences of their benighted rule..</p>
<p>EDSA 1’s failure to deliver on its implicit promises of peace, prosperity, freedom, independence and democracy, for which the political dynasties are as responsible, does not justify the return of another dictatorship. But it is nevertheless another fallacy the hucksters and demagogues in and out of government are currently selling in their attempt to excuse the country’s descent into another tyranny.</p>

<p>Instantly the ripostes were vigorous – denials, condemnations – from a broad range of personalities and organizations here and overseas, including from the Commission on Human Rights. The CHR has denounced the “harassment and vilification of lawyers” as a “new trend of attacking progressive rights groups.” It called on the government to ensure the protection specifically of members of the Union of People’s Lawyers of Mindanao (UPLM) and the National Union of People’s Lawyers (NUPL).</p>
<p>The National Task Force (NTF) was formed through Executive Order No. 70, which President Duterte signed on Dec. 4, 2018. Headed by Duterte as chair and his national security adviser Hermogenes Esperon Jr. as vice chair, the NTF is mandated to ensure the effective implementation of a “whole-of-nation” approach aimed at ending the 50-year-old armed revolutionary movement, led by the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army (CPP-NPA).</p>
<p>On Feb. 14, a NTF-initiated government delegation was sent to the meeting of the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances (UN WGEID) in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Its purpose: to ask the UN WGEID to delist 625 cases of enforced disappearances in the Philippines, mostly attributed to state security forces, documented by human rights organizations from 1975 (under Marcos’ martial law dictatorship) to 2012 (first two years of the P-Noy Aquino administration).</p>
<p>The delegation claimed that the Philippine government had already put in place a “strong legal framework and institutional mechanisms” to deal with the enforced disappearances issue. However, human rights groups led by Karapatan urged the UN body to reject the government request and its arguments for the delisting. Karapatan asserted that the two laws invoked by the Duterte administration – the Anti-Enforced Disappearance Act of 2012 (RA 10353) and the Human Rights Violations Recognition and Reparations Act of 2013 (RA 10368) were not state-initiated. These were enacted, it pointed out, mainly due to the efforts of the people, relatives of the victims, human rights groups, and concerned legislators.</p>
<p>Most pointedly, Karapatan told the UN that, to this day, the government has continually denied any role in enforced disappearances, such as the widely publicized case of Jonas Burgos in 2007 and most recently (September 2018), the case of Joey Torres Jr., Bayan Muna coordinator in Nueva Ecija.</p>
<p>Piggy-backing on the UN WGEID meeting, the NTF sent a team to visit diplomatic offices of various countries and aid organizations in Europe, campaigning for the withdrawal or denial of funding and other forms of support to human rights organizations and defenders in the Philippines, tagging the latter as “fronts” of the CPP-NPA. Two officials of the Presidential Communications Operations Office were with the NTF team, PCOO chief Martin Andanar acknowledged.</p>
<p>Among others, here are other instances of red-tagging in the month of February alone:</p>
<p>On Feb. 23, Iglesia Filipina Independiente (IFI) Obispo Maximo (Supreme Bishop) Rhee Timbang issued a pastoral letter strongly denouncing a flyer distributed in Cagayan de Oro City and Northern Mindanao. The flyer “maliciously and irresponsibly red-tagg(ed) our clergy,” the pastoral letter states, naming IFI bishops Felixberto Calang and Antonio Ablon, priests Rolando Abejo, Khen Apus and Chris Ablon, and “some prominent partners of the IFI in its work.”</p>
<p>“We again cry foul to these baseless accusations and condemn in the strongest terms the continuing attacks on our clergy and the IFI itself,” the letter says, along with the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT), (UPLM), and (NUPL), which are “partners in the IFI’s work of prophetic witness, social advocacy and solidarity and engagements with the peasants, fisherfolk, workers, urban poor, lumad communities, and the Moro people.”</p>
<p>All these activities, the pastoral letter adds, “are in consonance with (IFI’s) mission and fidelity to its history enriched by the bold, courageous and fearless witnesses of Apo [Gregorio] Aglipay and Don Belong [Isabelo delos Reyes] and other heroes of the Filipino church in the nationalist and revolutionary tradition of the Filipino people.”</p>
<p>Addressing President Duterte, the IFI pastoral letter warns that the red-tagging “serves as green light for the neutralization and termination” of all those the state security forces mark “wrongly as terrorists,” thus endangering the lives of IFI clergy and partners. It urges Duterte to “make history by standing for his people, by directing the GRP peace panel to resume peace talks [with the NDFP] and resolve the basic problems of our society that breed insurgency.”</p>
<p>Human rights and labor lawyer Beverly Selim-Musni, who with her two lawyer-daughters are tagged in the flyer along with the IFI clergy, spoke loud and clear: “The bias of my daughters for the poor and the oppressed is distinct, much more [it’s] my pride, since they have inherited my compassion.” Their father, Oscar Musni, she pointed out, was a member of the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG) and a political detainee under the Marcos dictatorship.</p>
<p>“The attacks against lawyers under the administration of President Duterte, a lawyer himself, are not new and not only in Northern Mindanao,” Selim-Musni noted. “Moreover, the attacks against the brave lawyers who have chosen the hard battle of fighting repressive state mechanisms is consistent with the history of our country’s repressive governments.”</p>
<p>The courageous stand taken by progressive lawyers since the time of Marcos has led to the sacrifice of the lives and liberty of many of them. After the slaying of human rights lawyer Benjamin Ramos in Negros Occidental last November, the CHR called for steps to prevent another killing. At least 78 lawyers have signed a petition asking the Supreme Court to ensure a “thorough, prompt, impartial, and independent investigation” into the killings of 34 lawyers so far under the Duterte administration.</p>
<p>The red-tagging has also formed part of the Duterte regime’s avowed campaign to prevent progressive candidates from winning in the May 13 mid-term elections. On Feb. 28, copies of a leaflet bearing the face of Makabayan Coalition senatorial bet Neri Colmenares began circulating in Manila. It depicts Colmenares, with a red hammer-and-sickle sign on his forehead, as allegedly making statements maligning the Liberal Party’s Otso Diretso senatorial slate.</p>
<p>There is of course absolutely no truth to this despicable stunt, as we shall see in the next two days.</p>

<p>“This series of attacks, bigoted and fantastic as they are, is not only disturbing but can be ominous of even worse things to come.”</p>
<p><strong>By ANNE MARXZE D. UMIL</strong><br />
<em><a href="http://bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA – National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) chairperson Fidel Agcaoili has set the record straight amid allegations that he is part of the National Union of People’s Lawyers (NUPL) to cover up the “legal complaints filed against the New People’s Army.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ndfp.org/setting-the-record-straight/?fbclid=IwAR39UCo8ocJDOL28RzMdf6nwPxQMVK-stl039KfS3d1DKAJ9xrKwi9_MvOg">Agcaoili released a statement</a> after a group called No to Communist Terrorist Group Coalition (NCTGC) accused him of “handling” the legal affairs of the NUPL which the group also accused as front organization of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1063066">Mario Laude, the coalition’s spokesperson, said </a>that NUPL is under Agcaoili’s command to “use it as the shield of the Party against complaints of human rights abuses, legal complaints filed in courts so that top level officials of the CTG (communist terrorist group) could be spared of.” He added that Agcaoili should be held accountable to what they call as “criminal acts” of the revolutionary forces.</p>
<p>“For the record, I am not a lawyer, never had the ambition to be one despite coming from a family of lawyers,” Agcaoili said adding that he has nothing to do with the lawyers’ group.</p>
<p>He said some NUPL lawyers are legal consultants of the NDFP Negotiating Panel and also serve as legal counsels of the detained NDFP consultants and political prisoners. However, Agcaoili said, this does not mean that the NUPL is a so-called front of the CPP or its lawyers are members of the Party.</p>
<p>“In accordance with due process, it is for any court of law, be it revolutionary or reactionary, to determine the truth of such allegations through competent and admissible evidence and not through manufactured witnesses or planted evidence like what is brazenly happening now,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Agcoaili meanwhile warned that such red-tagging of the people&#8217;s lawyers is &#8220;meant to set them up for the kill.&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_98354" style="width: 547px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fva-kodao.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-98354" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fva-kodao-547x365.jpg" alt="" width="547" height="365" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fva-kodao-547x365.jpg 547w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fva-kodao-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fva-kodao-840x560.jpg 840w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fva-kodao-272x182.jpg 272w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fva-kodao.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 547px) 100vw, 547px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">National Democratic Front of the Philippines chief negotiator Fidel Agcaoili.

<p>&#8220;But red-tagging has a more sinister objective. It is meant to smear any organization or individual to set them up for the kill, as has been shown in many cases in the past such as those of NDFP consultant Randy Malayao and NUPL lawyer Benjamin Ramos,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><strong>Intensified attacks against people’s lawyers</strong></p>
<p>The NUPL also cried foul over the allegation of Laude and the recent red tagging of lawyers and organizations affiliated with the NUPL. For the past two weeks, the group said, their members have been consistently red-tagged and labeled as members of the underground group Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) – New People’s Army (NPA)-National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP).</p>
<p>Last week, Feb. 22, a list was circulated around Cagayan de Oro in Mindanao tagging NUPL, its affiliate Union of Peoples’ Lawyers in Mindanao (UPLM) and three women lawyers; Beverly Ann Musni Yr. and her two daughters, Czarina and Beverly Musni as members of the CPP-NDFP-NPA.</p>
<p>With the three women lawyers, 19 individuals and four organizations were tagged as communists. The Musnis are actively involved in human rights cases and public interest advocacies.</p>
<p>The Daily Tribune publisher Ninez Cacho-Olivares also blatantly tagged the NUPL and NUPL president Edre Olalia as leftists and “commies” in her <a href="http://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2019/02/22/out-of-step-again/">column also published on Feb. 22</a>, where she wrote about the Supreme Court’s recent decision to the third extension of martial law in Mindanao. Olivares hit the NUPL for criticizing the SC in its decision to uphold the constitutionality of the extension of martial law.</p>
<p>NUPL represented the Makabayan bloc in the petition against martial law.</p>
<p>And recently, Laude accused NUPL as CPP front organization. “Aside from this ridiculous and baseless link, the shady group is inciting reprisal,” Olalia said.</p>
<p>“This series of attacks, bigoted and fantastic as they are, is not only disturbing but can be ominous of even worse things to come. It remains a challenge and clarion call though for human rights and public interest lawyers to stay the course and serve those who have less in life who have even lesser in law,” Olalia added.</p>
<p>Under President Duterte there were already 36 lawyers, judges and prosecutors who have been killed, said Olalia.</p>
<p>The most recent was the <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/11/07/rights-lawyer-gunned-down-in-negros/">killing of Ramos</a>, a human rights lawyer killed on Nov. 6, 2018 by two unidentified men in Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental. He was the secretary-general of NUPL-Negros Island chapter.</p>
<p>They were also not spared from trumped up charges for assisting their poor clients. Another NUPL lawyer <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/11/12/kathy-panguban-no-lazy-sundays-for-this-young-peoples-lawyer/">Kathy Panguban</a>, head of the NUPL Women and Children Committee was charged with kidnapping for assisting a mother in getting custody of her minor son in Sagay.</p>
<p>“Red-tagging may be viewed as a badge of honor for those who appreciate the value and role of being lawyers for the people. But in the real world out there, it is a stampmark that one can be fair game for vicious attacks from the intolerant, bigoted and despotic,” Olalia said. <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>Since December, Bulatlat and several alternative media outfits have been experiencing a series of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, where the server of a website is maliciously being overloaded to shut it down.</p>
<p><strong>By ALYSSA MAE CLARIN</strong><br />
<em><a href="http://bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em> </p>
<p>MANILA &#8212; It is time to fight back to defend press freedom.</p>
<p>This was the overall message during the recently-held forum by National Union of Peoples&#8217; Lawyers and online news Bulatlat dubbed as &#8216;Cyber-attacks on Critical media and Legal Remedies’ as cyber-attacks against alternative media outfits and websites of progressive organizations continue to intensify.</p>
<p>Frank Lloyd Tiongson of the NUPL said those behind the attackers may be held to account as provided in the controversial Cybercrime Prevention Act, which covers offenses that compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer systems.</p>
<p>Since December, Bulatlat and several alternative media outfits have been experiencing a series of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, where the server of a website is maliciously being overloaded to shut it down. Sweden-based Qurium Media Foundation, which has been helping Bulatlat and several others to fend off attacks, has documented the same attack signature.</p>
<p>Bulatlat associate editor and University of the Philippines professor Danilo Arao said that while Bulatlat may not share the heavy traffic of that of the dominant media, the motives behind the attack could be its content. As such, these well-funded attacks prove to be state-sponsored.</p>
<p>Tiongson said that the attacks could fall under ‘system interference’ or intentional hindering with the functioning of a computer network by inputting, damaging, altering, or suppressing the computer program. Perpetrators, once identified and found guilty, may be sent behind bars with a fine between P200,000 to P10 million, depending if it is carried out by an individual or corporation, and if it is done deliberately or not.</p>
<p>However, since the process of filing charges for the violation of the Cybercrime Prevention Act is quite invasive as provided in the so-called “warrants,” media that are currently under cyber-attacks may still seek civil damages.</p>
<p>“That’s what a lot of governments and a lot of dictatorial regimes tend to misrecognize. When they suppress freedom of expression, they actually expose themselves to more pressure,” said Tiongson discussing the many legal boundaries being made to stifle press freedom.</p>
<p><strong>Decriminalize libel</strong></p>
<p>In the same vein, veteran journalist Inday Espina-Varona noted that it is high time to once again call for the decriminalization of libel, which carries a heavier penalty under the Cybercrime Prevention Act.</p>
<p>The law itself, she added, is “very very oppressive” as journalists have the burden of proving that their reports were written without malice. Varona said this deters journalists from truth-telling.</p>
<p>The Philippine’s criminal sanction for libel has been written off as ‘excessive’ by the United Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC) on October 2011 saying, “It is impermissible for a State party to indict a person for criminal defamation but then not to proceed to trial expeditiously – such a practice has a chilling effect that may unduly restrict the exercise of freedom of expression of the person concerned and others.”</p>
<p>UNHR believes that although it is only right for individuals to be protected from unethical journalism, the application of the criminal law should only be allowed for the most serious of cases, and that imprisonment is never an appropriate penalty. <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a>  </p>
