<p>Since December, Bulatlat and several alternative media outfits have been experiencing a series of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, where the server of a website is maliciously being overloaded to shut it down.</p>
<p><strong>By ALYSSA MAE CLARIN</strong><br />
<em><a href="http://bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em> </p>
<p>MANILA &#8212; It is time to fight back to defend press freedom.</p>
<p>This was the overall message during the recently-held forum by National Union of Peoples&#8217; Lawyers and online news Bulatlat dubbed as &#8216;Cyber-attacks on Critical media and Legal Remedies’ as cyber-attacks against alternative media outfits and websites of progressive organizations continue to intensify.</p>
<p>Frank Lloyd Tiongson of the NUPL said those behind the attackers may be held to account as provided in the controversial Cybercrime Prevention Act, which covers offenses that compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of computer systems.</p>
<p>Since December, Bulatlat and several alternative media outfits have been experiencing a series of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, where the server of a website is maliciously being overloaded to shut it down. Sweden-based Qurium Media Foundation, which has been helping Bulatlat and several others to fend off attacks, has documented the same attack signature.</p>
<p>Bulatlat associate editor and University of the Philippines professor Danilo Arao said that while Bulatlat may not share the heavy traffic of that of the dominant media, the motives behind the attack could be its content. As such, these well-funded attacks prove to be state-sponsored.</p>
<p>Tiongson said that the attacks could fall under ‘system interference’ or intentional hindering with the functioning of a computer network by inputting, damaging, altering, or suppressing the computer program. Perpetrators, once identified and found guilty, may be sent behind bars with a fine between P200,000 to P10 million, depending if it is carried out by an individual or corporation, and if it is done deliberately or not.</p>
<p>However, since the process of filing charges for the violation of the Cybercrime Prevention Act is quite invasive as provided in the so-called “warrants,” media that are currently under cyber-attacks may still seek civil damages.</p>
<p>“That’s what a lot of governments and a lot of dictatorial regimes tend to misrecognize. When they suppress freedom of expression, they actually expose themselves to more pressure,” said Tiongson discussing the many legal boundaries being made to stifle press freedom.</p>
<p><strong>Decriminalize libel</strong></p>
<p>In the same vein, veteran journalist Inday Espina-Varona noted that it is high time to once again call for the decriminalization of libel, which carries a heavier penalty under the Cybercrime Prevention Act.</p>
<p>The law itself, she added, is “very very oppressive” as journalists have the burden of proving that their reports were written without malice. Varona said this deters journalists from truth-telling.</p>
<p>The Philippine’s criminal sanction for libel has been written off as ‘excessive’ by the United Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC) on October 2011 saying, “It is impermissible for a State party to indict a person for criminal defamation but then not to proceed to trial expeditiously – such a practice has a chilling effect that may unduly restrict the exercise of freedom of expression of the person concerned and others.”</p>
<p>UNHR believes that although it is only right for individuals to be protected from unethical journalism, the application of the criminal law should only be allowed for the most serious of cases, and that imprisonment is never an appropriate penalty. <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a>  </p>

<p>2nd Part in a Series of 3 <strong>(<em>DENR in mock Battle for Manila Bay rehab?</em></strong>)</p>
<p>What is common in the stories of the residents in various coastal sitios of Bulacan is that the “news” about their impending displacement is coming to them in trickles of information packaged in a threat.</p>
<p>Read the 1st Part: <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2019/02/27/bulacan-fisherfolk-women-want-genuine-inclusive-manila-bay-rehabilitation/">Bulacan fisherfolk, women want genuine, inclusive Manila Bay rehabilitation</a></p>
<p><em>This is one of the reports in a series produced by Bulatlat.com with the Asia-Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development <a href="https://apwld.org">(APWLD) Media Fellowship</a>. The series aims to report on linkages between gender, ecological conflicts and climate change.</em></p>
<p><strong>By MARYA SALAMAT</strong><br />
<em><a href="http://bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA &#8212; Until April of last year, the fisherfolk communities in coastal Bulacan were hearing only unconfirmed talk about the San Miguel Corporation’s 2,500-hectare aerotropolis and new city project. The news about the proposed reclamation affecting the island-communities along Manila Bay in Bulacan formally broke out in April 2018, when the National Economic and Development Authority <a href="https://www.philstar.com/business/2018/04/26/1809642/smcs-bulacan-airport-proposal-other-projects-get-neda-boards-nod">(NEDA) Board approved the San Miguel Corporation’s proposal</a>. But the buying spree of former salt farms along the rivers and mangroves has been happening for years already, the residents said. Some said they have been told they have to leave the area soon.</p>
<p>“Hindi kami hinaharap ni Mayor. ‘Hindi namin alam yan.’” (The town mayor of Bulakan, Bulacan) won’t talk to us. If asked about the SMC project, he’d reply, ‘We don’t know about that.’) For one and a half years this is how the Bulacan fisherfolk say they have been treated, until they mounted protest actions, said a UP professor who conducted a series of research among the Bulakan fisherfolk since last year.</p>
<p>In the village of Capol, the residents have been seeing land surveyors taking measurements of the shallow pool. Asked who sent them, some surveyors replied their company is just a contractor in charge of titling the land, among others.</p>
<p>In another sitio called Camansi, Flor Salvador, 77, said she first heard about some developers’ plans for Taliptip three years ago. They have been told also they will have to go.</p>
<p>She said that in her heart she refuses to believe that someday, as they were being told informally, they will be forced to leave the place to give way to these “developments.” When <em>Bulatlat </em>interviewed her, she was still tending to her small yard. Her house faces hectares of former saltbeds turned into fishponds.   At the time the fish had just been harvested and the water drained out to the Manila Bay.</p>

(Photo by M. Salamat / Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure>
<p>She arrived here in 1969, Salvador said. Like many here, she worked at the salt farms before her family turned to full-time fishing. In her old age, she has found work watching over someone else’s fishponds and planting stringbeans on the soil embankment.</p>
<p>But she hasn’t heard yet of relocation for “fishpond caretakers.”</p>
<p>What sounded common in the stories of the residents in various sitios is that the “news” about their impending displacement is coming to them in trickles of information packaged in a threat. Other residents told <em>Bulatlat</em>, on condition of anonymity, that they were being castigated by the mayor, some by the village captain, if they were seen joining meetings with supporters from &#8220;outside.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though they have lived and worked as tenants in Bulakan salt farms for decades until most of it stopped operating and were sold off to developers, they remained deprived of land tenure for lack of land reform or other tenurial support from the government. Now, the resulting poverty and landlessness is being used against them to speed up their forcible displacement.</p>
<p>Even the BFAR (Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources) told the fisherfolk representatives in a dialogue late last year <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/10/18/we-will-go-hungry-die-from-worse-flooding-if-smc-buries-part-of-manila-bay-for-land-projects-fisherfolk/">there were only two registered leaseholders in Taliptip</a>.</p>
<p>Without tenurial rights over the land or the fishing grounds, the communities of fisherfolk have been automatically denied a say in land use and planning concerning their river-and-bay-based livelihood.</p>
<p>It took the residents various pickets, requests for dialogue with the local government and agencies, with representatives of San Miguel Corporation, with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, among others, before they were told bits and pieces about the reclamation project. And before some vague “relocation” was floated. Even when the <a href="http://conceptnewscentral.com/index.php/2018/04/10/smc-airport-project-to-spur-economic-growth-of-bulacan/">local government executives in Bulacan had already welcomed the plan</a> of SMC, confirming what they had long avoided saying to their enquiring constituents, the residents were still kept blind as to who and where the project will directly hit.</p>
<p>Some residents interviewed by <em>Bulatlat</em> said they were getting warnings against joining protest actions or meetings. They were told they will receive no aid or no chance at this unnamed relocation.</p>
<p>When two representatives of San Miguel Corporation (SMC) met with church people and women leaders of Bulacan fisherfolk in Malolos City November last year, they avoided mentioning “reclamation”. They refused to answer questions regarding where or how their proposed aerotropolis will be built, considering there are fishing communities in the (then) rumored proposed site.</p>
<p>“You are not likely to build a hanging airport over rivers and mangroves, right?” a woman from Taliptip asked.</p>
<p>On February 4, the fisherfolk finally heard the first concrete plans through an SMC contractor. In a “public hearing” held at an evacuation center in Bulakan, Bulacan, representatives of SMC contractor, Silvertides Holdings Corporation, confirmed the company had acquired a total of 2,375 hectares of titled “fishponds” in the coastal villages of Bambang and Taliptip in Bulakan, Bulacan. This contractor’s job is to perform the reclamation.</p>

<p>The Feb 4 hearing is second to the last requirement for the SMC contractor to get an Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) that would pave the way to reclamation.</p>
<p>The report Silvertides presented to the fisherfolk bears also the mark of the Environment Management Bureau (EMB) in Region 3.</p>
<p>Silvertides confirmed that the fisherfolk in Taliptip and Bambang are at the “direct hit areas” while the villages two to three kilometers surrounding it are the “indirect hit” of the reclamation project.</p>
<p>The SMC contractor said they will “backfill” the 2,375 hectares of fishponds by at least 3 meters. This is estimated to require 205 million cubic meters of fill materials that they may source from Pampanga.</p>
<p>“Why did the government just approve such a proposal without even thinking of us?” asked Taliptip fisherwoman Monica Anastacio, 63, one of the spokespersons of the Network Opposed to Reclamation and Aerotropolis in Bulacan.</p>
<p>The “public hearing” last February 4 centered on the contractor stressing the mechanics of the reclamation and mitigating measures for those who would be adversely affected. It was not about the communities having a say in whether the reclamation will push through or not. Rather, it was about notifying those who will be affected and informing them there are other livelihood opportunities. It mentioned there will likely be aid for those qualified to receive it.</p>

<p>To compile the report they presented to the “public hearing,&#8221; Silvertides said they held scoping and fieldwork from October to November last year. That’s the same period some fisherfolk in the villages of Bulakan and Obando convened the Network Opposed to Reclamation and Aerotropolis in Bulacan.</p>
<p>The SMC contractor submitted their draft Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to EMB Region 3 in December last year. They held the “public hearing” as part of a “review process” from which they will submit an assessment report to the EMB Region 3. The EMB Region 3 will then decide on their application for ECC.</p>

Salamat / Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure>
<p>An estimated 5,000 fisherfolk stand to lose livelihood and homes in SMC’s $14-million plus airport project. Others more stand to lose their fishing grounds given the volume of backfilling that will be carried by barges and heavy machineries to the coastline.</p>
<p>To questions whether the fisherfolk could maintain their livelihood, the SMC representatives, in a dialogue facilitated by the Bulacan Ecumenical Forum in Malolos, replied the fisherfolk can avail of retraining, livelihood opportunities and priority employment instead. In a different forum, Silvertide’s presentation mentions relocation for “fishpond caretakers”.</p>
<p>But in the same way that not everyone in the “direct hit areas” are considered “fishpond caretakers” and thus qualified for relocation, not all of the mangroves in the direct hit areas seem safe.</p>
<p>Silvertide’s presentation pointed to just two “patches of mangroves” closest to the Manila Bay that they will “incorporate in the design.”  They leave out the patches of mangroves along the river of Taliptip and Bambang.</p>
<p><strong>Planned reclamation contrary to calls for rehabilitation</strong></p>
<p>As early as January this year the group Kalikasan People’s Network for the Environment has warned against the dangerous haste of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) in ordering the removal of informal settlers as if doing so is the main answer to Manila Bay pollution. In reality, the government has much to answer for, not the poor.  Kalikasan and Pamalakaya have both cited as bigger culprit the government failure in providing sufficient waste management facilities, including its support to problematic positioning of waste diversion facilities themselves.</p>
<p>Kalikasan cited the data from National Solid Waste Management Commission that says only 32 percent of villages across the country are serviced by a Materials Recovery Facility, and only 24 percent of local government units have access to Sanitary Landfills as of September 2018.</p>
<p>PAMALAKAYA cited as example the Obando sanitary landfill located in Obando, Bulacan owned by Ecoshield Development Corp. (EDC) and supported by the government. It has polluted not only the waters of Obando but brought its stench to residents of nearby Navotas City and Malabon City in Manila. Other waste disposal facilities operated in Manila Bay, Pamalakaya said. This includes the landfill in Pier 18 in Tondo, Manila that had been reported before for dumping toxic wastes in Manila Bay.</p>
<p>The destruction of mangrove, seagrass, and other coastal and marine ecosystems that serve as the natural pollution filters of Manila Bay is also a major culprit in its worsening pollution, Kalikasan said in a statement. Not only this, the environmentalists and urban poor in Manila Bay have long noted the <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2014/07/21/group-warns-of-worse-storm-surges-flooding-with-planned-reclamation/">disastrous effects of reclamation</a> not just on fish catch but also in helping to break the fury of storms. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2013/02/09/fishers-experts-call-for-10-year-moratorium-on-reclamation/">Various independent and scientific studies on reclamation in Panglao, Bohol, Cordova (of Cebu)</a> and in the Manila Bay have extensively demonstrated how it resulted in reduced productivity and biodiversity, disrupted vital ecosystem functions, increased vulnerability to floods, and displaced and dislocated thousands of families dependent on the affected environments for their livelihood.</p>
<p>At least 28,647 hectares of currently approved reclamation projects are clearly overlapped on the remaining mangrove expanses and seagrass beds along the whole stretch of Manila. A part of it is in Bulacan, 2,500- hectares as announced by the San Miguel Corporation, but the contractor set to conduct the reclamation says the areas two to three kilometers surrounding the 2,500 hectares will also be affected.</p>
<p>The fisherfolk interviewed by <em>Bulatlat</em> cannot imagine life away from their banca and fishing. “Every move we make is on the river,” a fisherman who grew up in Taliptip said. His sentiment is echoed by his neighbors.</p>

<p>The fish and seafood produced from the rich brackish waters for reclamation in SMC drawing board are currently being sold on fish ports of Navotas, Malabon and other towns, said the survey itself of SMC contractor Silvertides.</p>
<p>“We are really dependent for our livelihood on these rivers and on these mud,” the second-generation fisherman in Taliptip said. His now senior citizen parents also cannot think of life away from the river.</p>
<p>As of this writing the fisherfolk communities are gearing up to hold assemblies in defense of the river and the bay.  <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>“…if traditional politicians will be here to stay, then this will be no different from the past attempts to build an autonomous region.”</p>
<p><strong>By JANESS ANN J. ELLAO</strong><br />
<em><a href="http://bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA &#8212; With the recent swearing in of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority that will assume interim leadership in the villages and cities now confirmed part of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), questions on the future of the Moro people &#8211; their struggles and aspirations &#8211; have once again been brought to the fore.</p>
<p>Provinces in the formerly-known Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao, Cotabato City, and 63 other villages of North Cotabato will now constitute the BARMM. The new region, under the Bangsamoro Organic Law, will be governed by an 80-member transition body until its first regular elections in 2022.</p>
<p>But critics are skeptical over what appears to be a focus on the structural changes that the implementation of the Bangsamoro Organic Law may bring to the Moro people.</p>
<p><strong>Structural changes</strong></p>
<p>On its face, the BARMM will introduce structural changes to the Moro people&#8217;s political sphere, arriving at a parliament form of governance after the national government has, in the past, introduced many &#8220;experiments&#8221; to address what they referred to as an ethno-struggle.</p>
<p>Professor Julkipli Wadi of the University of the Philippines Institute of Islamic Studies said the MILF hopes to bring their struggle to another level, parliamentary politics, to attain their right to self-determination.</p>
<figure id="attachment_106693" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2019/02/28/can-bangsamoro-autonomous-region-bring-genuine-peace-to-moro-people/51f76a39-11dd-472a-ba1e-501c9991b0a1/" rel="attachment wp-att-106693"><img class="size-full wp-image-106693" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51F76A39-11DD-472A-BA1E-501C9991B0A1.jpeg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51F76A39-11DD-472A-BA1E-501C9991B0A1.jpeg 800w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51F76A39-11DD-472A-BA1E-501C9991B0A1-548x365.jpeg 548w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51F76A39-11DD-472A-BA1E-501C9991B0A1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/51F76A39-11DD-472A-BA1E-501C9991B0A1-272x182.jpeg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(Photo courtesy of Kodao Productions)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Wadi noted that the added and new factor under the Bangsamoro Organic Law is that their &#8220;former enemies&#8221; are now their &#8220;partners&#8221; in governing the Moro people. This, he added, may result to an &#8220;identity crisis&#8221; among the MILF leadership.</p>
<p>Wadi, however, noted that the organic law has lost its &#8220;venom&#8221; and &#8220;teeth&#8221; as it may one day be easily amended according to the whims of those seating in Congress.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Suara Bangsamoro&#8217;s Amira Lidasan pointed out that the development plan for the BARMM will practically remain the same, most especially how natural resources will be utilized.</p>
<p>&#8220;We always rank as &#8216;first honor&#8217; in inflation and poverty incidence. What will happen if the same development plan will be used?&#8221; she said</p>
<p><strong>Holding the line</strong></p>
<p>The ARMM experience, Wadi said, showed how there was never really genuine decentralization as only those that had the blessings of the national government could run and consequently win the gubernatorial post during elections.</p>
<p>He added that &#8220;imperial Manila&#8221; will not allow the genuine fulfillment of the Moro people&#8217;s right to self-determination. As such, they will need traditional local politicians to be their lackeys.</p>
<p>Wadi explained that there will now be a new relationship between the national government and the parliament. But if traditional politicians will be here to stay, then this will be no different from the past attempts to build an autonomous region.</p>
<p>Lidasan said that instead of the Moro people&#8217;s genuine representatives, they are hearing reports from the ground that politicians and Duterte himself who are seemingly having the upper hand in the transition body.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have hi-jacked the Moro people&#8217;s struggle,&#8221; she said during a forum in the University of the Philippines dubbed as &#8220;Eyes on the BOL,&#8221; adding that their right to self-determination should not be treated as mere adornments</p>
<p>Meanwhile, during the open forum, former lawmaker Satur Ocampo shared that the total disarmament among the ranks of the MILF will create a lopsided political scenario as the national government is doing too little steps to disband private armies.</p>
<p><strong>Like Ampatuan all over again</strong></p>
<p>Lidasan pointed out that the heavy deployment of state security forces in BARMM and the discrepancies pointed out during the BOL plebiscites remind the public of the Ampatuan era during the 2007 elections, referring to the 12-0 votes in favor of then re-electionist Gloria Macapagal Arroyo&#8217;s senatorial slate in areas that are bailiwick of the Ampatuan clan.</p>
<p>&#8220;They say it was a mere clerical error. But under martial law, can truth ever be set free?&#8221; Lidasan asked.</p>
<p>Martial law, she pointed out, played a big part in the referendum as more than 20,000 soldiers and police officers have been deployed.</p>
<p><strong>Political vacuum</strong></p>
<p>Wadi said the MILF stands to lose support from the ground as a result of a possible identity crisis among its leadership.</p>
<p>Wadi said the mainstreaming of the armed revolution being waged by the Moro people as a result of the Bangsamoro Organic Law may leave a vacuum both in their territories and in their ideology.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will transitional justice be enough? Reparation? Social fund?&#8221; asked Wadi.</p>
<p>The UP professor said this will become a &#8220;fertile ground&#8221; for new forms of struggle. <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a> </p>

<p>(1st in a series of 3: DENR in Mock Battle for Manila Bay rehab?)</p>
<p><strong>By MARYA SALAMAT</strong><br />
<em><a href="http://bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p><em>This is one of the reports in a series produced by Bulatlat.com with the Asia-Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development <a href="https://apwld.org">(APWLD) Media Fellowship</a>. The series aims to report on linkages between gender, ecological conflicts and climate change.</em></p>
<p>MANILA – If there are groups of Filipinos whose daily life confronts the most immediate impact of climate change, the fisherfolk are among those at the forefront. Their families live by the sea, on the banks of rivers and on islets that shrink or expand with the tide.</p>
<p>They are the first to face the consequences of sea levels rising more than usual, when the typhoons that brew from the seas are more disastrous, or when currents are hitting the land more brutally after some natural guards or breaks had been defaced. For example, after 600-plus old-growth mangroves were cut in April last year, there were changes in the water and they felt it immediately in their reduced catch.</p>
<p><strong>How the poor fisherfolk cope with changing climate</strong></p>
<p>In the coastal communities fronting Manila Bay in Bulacan, “climate change” is not a household word but they grapple with coping solutions in their daily life. One ready example, they have to more frequently repair and raise their embankment or their “waterwalk”.</p>
<figure id="attachment_106664" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-106664" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20180928_173911_women_hanging_outOn_thefoot_bridge_dl.jpg" alt="Bulacan rivers" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20180928_173911_women_hanging_outOn_thefoot_bridge_dl.jpg 640w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20180928_173911_women_hanging_outOn_thefoot_bridge_dl-548x365.jpg 548w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20180928_173911_women_hanging_outOn_thefoot_bridge_dl-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Project Walkway</figcaption></figure>
<p>Living on narrow strips of land above water, dry space is scarce and to extend the living areas they build houses on stilts, connected by walkways fashioned from strung-together poles of bamboos. Less than a meter in width, the walkway loops around their island-homes, their collectively-built adjustment to the fact that the island is not wide enough.</p>
<p>From another sitio or sub-village, in a separate interview, an elderly woman recalled how, years earlier, they had more earthen embankments. The sitios were connected by more levees unlike today. “We could walk from one sitio to another in those days,” said Flor P. Salvador, 77, a resident of Taliptip since 1969. Now they have to ride a banca just to visit neighboring sitios.</p>
<p>In the bigger island-village of Binuangan, Obando, the walkway is more easily worn out not just by the trudging feet but by the higher water levels and stronger currents. Similar to what they have to do with their houses, they have to raise it by piling more wood or bamboo on top of the old parts.</p>
<p>Some families rebuilt their home using concrete and cement. It protects them better during storms. “Our houses don’t just get swept away or destroyed,” an old fisherman told <em>Bulatlat</em>.</p>

<p>In the coasts of Bulakan, Bulacan, the communities are scattered over rivers and shallow loam soil narrower than Salambao or Binuangan of Obando.</p>
<p>Despite all these, the people here have adjusted to living with the river and the bay. They are proud to say they are feeding themselves and their families, sending their children to school without asking much from the government. They contribute to the country’s need for relatively affordable fresh fish, shells and crabs.</p>

<p>They are in position to raise the alarm when the precarious balance of this ecosystem of rivers, islets and the bay was tinkered with, like when about a hectare of mangroves was felled in April last year. In the following visits of typhoons, <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/10/18/cutting-of-old-growth-mangroves-result-in-heavier-floods-in-taliptip/">they reported its worrisome results</a>. Various sitios of Bulakan, Bulacan suffered unprecedented flooding and soil erosion.</p>
<p><strong>Compounding problems</strong></p>
<p>Years before, these fisherfolk had fought to stop the privately owned but government-backed “sanitary landfill” from operating by the coasts of Manila Bay in Obando. It was a fierce struggle that older residents now say only the reign of terror of former army major Jovito Palparan under the former Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo administration enabled its forced operation. Some fisherfolk leaders and organizers in the area had been reportedly abducted, tortured and killed. The residents petitioned against it in court but in 2014 the Court of Appeals junked their petition and allowed the dumpsite to continue.</p>
<p>Kimberley Lazaro, 31, a resident of coastal Obando since birth, said that since the dumpsite was allowed, their fish catch has dwindled. They lost the mussels and crabs that used to abound at the muddy banks of the river. For a fisherwoman like her, it means spending more to go farther out on the river or the bay itself to catch fish.</p>

<p>“If you didn’t start out living around here, you could not endure the stench and the flies. You will eat under a mosquito netting,” she told her fellow fisherfolk as they convened the network opposed to the planned reclamation in Bulakan.</p>
<p>A lesson they have learned through years of forced landfills and reclamation along Manila Bay: this exacts a price and some are not as predictable as worsening pollution and dwindling fish catch. Their part of the coast in Obando now stinks, the river is more polluted, their communities are more vulnerable to flooding, erosion, and subsidence. Worse, these same poor fisherfolk are frequently the government’s scapegoat whenever they seek to push their brand of development of the bay.</p>
<p>Now the coastal communities’ initial efforts to cope, by themselves, with direct impact of climate change and worsening pollution while they shore up their communities and sources of livelihood are coming into conflict with government thrusts concerning the bay.</p>
<p>Ironically, while the government is riding on the popular call for cleanup of Manila Bay and harnessing free labor of volunteers for fishing out thrash that washed up in Manila Bay, it is, on the other hand, disproportionately blaming the poor and seeking their demolition in favor of reclamation plans and other real estate development.</p>
<p>Environmentalists Kalikasan PNE and national fisherfolk group Pamalakaya cited the study of Ocean Conservancy in 2015 that 74 percent of plastics that ended up in the sea came from previously collected garbage. Another cause of pollution in Manila Bay, they said, is the failure of government itself to provide a significant water and solid waste treatment and management.</p>
<p>Environmentalists and fisherfolk decry the seeming duplicity of dubbing the battle for Manila Bay as for rehabilitation when the government is pushing for projects such as massive reclamation and commercial developments of the Manila Bay. Toward this, the government seems to be facilitating the rapid, forced displacement of the fisherfolk settlers in the Manila Bay.</p>
<p>In the coastal areas and rivers in Bulacan, <a href="http://r3.denr.gov.ph/index.php/86-region-news-items/419-denr-launches-massive-cleanup-of-manila-bay-in-c-luzon">there are 23,051 “informal settler families (ISF)</a>,” said the Manila Bay Coordinating Office (MBCO) of DENR in Central Luzon during a scheduled Manila Bay cleanup held in Obando.</p>
<p>But the DENR has been silent about the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)-approved proposal of diversifying giant, San Miguel Corporation, to build an international airport on rivers, fishponds and mangroves in Bulacan along Manila Bay. This is more massive than the trash or the presence of ISF. It means burying the coast under million cubic meters of engineered soil and rock-cement. It means bringing in machinery for mega-construction and reclamation after the fisherfolk communities have been driven away.</p>

<p>It is not clear if the fisherfolk targeted for displacement by SMC’s reclamation project are also among the ISF complained by the MBCO in Region 3. What is clear is that since the locals began hearing about the San Miguel Corporation projects, the government and SMC have all but ignored their demands for information and a say in the future of the fishing grounds and the bay.</p>
<p>The locals say they would hear warnings that the SMC has a deep pocket and that they couldn’t win their demand to retain the fishing grounds as such. From October to November last year, a contractor company of SMC called Silvertides conducted surveys and interviews in coastal villages of Taliptip and Bambang. Around the same period, the locals were being told by this or that local government executive that they shouldn’t join groups criticizing the project.</p>
<p>The locals would only learn this February that the surveys and interviews of 30 “fishpond caretakers” Silvertides said they conducted were requirements for the SMC contractor to get the DENR nod for reclamation.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the fisherfolk were receiving news affecting their future only in trickles, in October some of them braved it out to establish the Network Opposed to Reclamation/Aerotropolis.</p>
<p>In November, fisherfolk, church workers, and environmental activists from Bulacan to Cavite gathered at the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) to <a href="http://kalikasan.net/articles/green-groups-urge-denr-to-deny-clearance-to-manila-bay-reclamation-projects/">file a Manila Bay-wide complaint </a>calling on the Duterte government. They asked the DENR to deny erring land reclamation projects their environmental compliance certificates (ECC) and area clearance permits.</p>

Salamat)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In a statement, Leon Dulce, national coordinator of the Kalikasan People’s Network for the Environment (Kalikasan PNE), said, “not one of these reclamation projects have passed key international human rights guidelines such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines.”</p>
<p>These guidelines for businesses include compliance to civil, political, and socio-economic rights policies in the Philippines, adopting internal human rights policies and contributing to the implementation and development of State policies, conducting due diligence in assessing and addressing rights concerns, and cooperating with legal remedy mechanisms.</p>
<p>Gauging from reports of affected locals from Cavite to Manila to Bulacan, the reclamation projects, said Dulce, have apparently grossly bastardized the public participation mechanisms and environmental regulations of the Environmental Impact Assessment process. The group also blasted the reports that critics of reclamation were being harassed.</p>
<p>Asking the DENR to side with the fisherfolk against reclamation, they reiterated that “There is no reason not to respect democratic procedures, even for the aerotropolis that is an unsolicited proposal not yet governed by the formal regulatory process of the State.” <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>“Truly, without their work, petitioner GMA would have nothing to air, hence the private respondents&#8217; services in the former&#8217;s television program were unquestionably necessary and essential.”</p>
<p>By <strong>RONALYN V. OLEA</strong><br />
<em><a href="http://bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA — The Court of Appeals upheld the decisions of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) declaring more than a hundred talents of broadcasting firm GMA 7 as regular employees.</p>
<p>In a 19-page decision dated Feb. 20, the CA’s Special 14th Division junked the petition for certiorari filed by GMA 7 management, saying it lacks merit.</p>
<p>Penned by Associate Justice Zenaida Galapate-Laguilles, the appellate court ruled that the talents are regular employees and they are part of production crew who, were undoubtedly performing functions necessary and essential to petitioner GMA&#8217;s business of broadcasting television.</p>
<p>“Truly, without their work, petitioner GMA would have nothing to air, hence the private respondents&#8217; services in the former&#8217;s television program were unquestionably necessary and essential,” the decision read.</p>
<p>The CA further said that even if the talents’ employment contracts were for a fixed term, these contracts have been renewed from one, three, or six months, or for one or five years. The successive renewals of these contracts, said the CA, indicated the necessity and desirability of their (talents’) work in the usual course of GMA.</p>
<p>The appellate court further asserted that the four -fold test to determine the existence of an employer-employee relationship was duly established in the said case. These are: the selection and engagement of the employee; the payment of wages; the power of dismissal; and the power to control the employee’s conduct.</p>

<p>The Talents Association of GMA (TAG) welcomed the decision.</p>
<p>Shao Masula, TAG vice president, told <em>Bulatlat</em>, “Waiting for Court of Appeals decision was sort of a torture — because the five years of blood, sweat, and tears that was shed for this fight might all go to waste.”</p>
<p>Masula, who has been with GMA for the past 15 years, recalled being mocked by colleagues for staging a street protest in front of GMA premises in June 2015. She said that some even called them ingrates for “biting the hands that feed us.”</p>

<p>Some of the TAG members were <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/07/09/gma-7-fires-11-talents/">dismissed</a> for participating in the rally.</p>
<p>“TAG members would ironically feel being ridiculed for standing for truth and for fighting for what is right,” Masula said.</p>
<p>In a statement, TAG said the purpose of their case was always clear — “to shine the light on a prevalent issue that affects millions of Filipinos and to increase the pressure on companies and the government, to stop this unjust, inhumane and illegal labor treatment.”</p>
<p>“This win in the CA is an affirmation for our cause,” Masula said.</p>
<p>While TAG recognizes that GMA 7 can still appeal to the Supreme Court, Masula is hopeful more than ever that the law is on the side of Filipino workers.</p>
<p>“They have the vast resources to fight us out in court, but we believe that what we lack in money and connections, we make up for by our best asset — the truth,” TAG said in a statement.</p>
<p>In a statement, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP) congratulated TAG in its victory. &#8220;Your unity and determination is an inspiration to us and all media workers seeking to improve their working conditions and economic welfare,&#8221; NUJP said.</p>
<p>The group also called on the owners and managers of GMA Network to immediately implement the CA decision. It also urged all other media companies to end the onerous policy of contractualization. <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>“All tyrants believe in forever. But history, especially People Power, shows that we, the people, eventually triumph.”</p>
<p><strong>By JANESS ANN J. ELLAO</strong><br />

<p>MANILA &#8212; The EDSA Shrine has once again been filled with battle cries of the Filipino people as a broad array of human rights defenders, workers, the urban poor, youth and students, and church people gathered for the 33th year since the EDSA uprising to call out the government for the &#8220;shadows of tyranny&#8221; under this administration.</p>
<p>People from all walks of life flocked to the gathering. Emotions seethe as they shouted chants against the return of an open dictatorial rule in the country, and sang songs of the people&#8217;s struggles and aspirations for peace, unity, and genuine democracy.</p>
<p>Several streamers calling for the end of martial law, and resist tyranny were hung at the footbridge along EDSA and Ortigas</p>
<p>Among those who joined the #TayoAngEDSA protest are former Chief Justice Ma. Lourdes Serreno, Bro. Armin Luistro, actress Mae Paner, former Agrarian Reform secretary Rafael Mariano, and progressive lawmakers such as Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate, Kabataan Rep. Sarah Elago and ACT Teachers Rep. Antonio Tinio.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tayo ang EDSA, tayo ang pag-asa. Tayo ang EDSA, labanan ang diktadura,&#8221; they chanted.</p>
<p>After the program, protesters marched along the stretch of the major thoroughfare and continued their protest action in front of Camp Aguinaldo&#8217;s Gate 2.</p>
<p>Sr. Mary John Mananzan of the Movement Against Tyranny said, “All tyrants believe in forever. But history, especially People Power, shows that we, the people, eventually triumph.”</p>
<p><strong>Gross human rights violations</strong></p>
<p>Protesters decried the continuing and intensifying human rights violations under the Duterte administration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there a good person who orders the killing of those who dare to dissent?&#8221; Pastor Irma Balaba of the National Council of Churches in the Philippines asked during the protest action.</p>
<p>In a statement, Bayan said that 33 years after the EDSA uprising, the country is still being &#8220;confronted with gross human rights violations reminscent of the Marcos years.&#8221;</p>
<p>For one, rampant killings and widespread red-tagging greeted Filipinos in 2019. Among the most recent is the military hitlist that named human rights defenders, church leaders, human rights lawyers and a journalist as so-called &#8220;terrorist&#8221; members of the Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed the New People&#8217;s Army.</p>
<p>This administration has at least 13 cases of massacres of farmers and human rights defenders. No perpetrators has ever been brought before the bar of justice.</p>
<p>In her speech in front of Camp Aguinaldo, Edith Burgos, mother of disappeared activist Jonas Burgos, belied claims that there are no human rights violations under the present administration &#8211; from drug-related killings to concerted attacks against those critical of the Duterte administration.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can commit graver crimes if you are a liar,&#8221; she pointed out.</p>
<p><strong>Misogyny</strong></p>

<p>One Billion Rising global director and #BabaeAko member Monique Wilson said the struggle against tyranny must be coupled with the fight against tyranny.</p>
<p>President Rodrigo Duterte has been widely criticized over his misogynistic statements. One of his infamous pronouncements is his order to have female armed guerilla fighters shot in their vaginas “to render them useless.”</p>
<p>Whenever in hot water, presidential spokespersons are quick to dismiss these as mere jokes. Wilson, who is also a theater actress, said it is not normal to resort to rape jokes. She added that misogyny is a tactic that the likes of Duterte and US president Donal Trump use to spread fascism and tyranny.</p>
<p>She called on not just women but also good men not to be silent over Duterte’s misogyny.</p>
<p>Various women’s groups joined today’s protest action. In a statement, the Center for Women’s Resources said, “three decades have passed yet the shadows of tyranny continue to haunt us. Despite the charges filed against them, the Marcoses continue to consolidate power, wealth and influence both in local and national governments.”</p>
<p><strong>Press freedom under attack</strong></p>

<p>Blogger Tonyo Cruz of the Let’s Organize for Democracy and Integrity urged the Filipino people not to allow anyone to trample on the people’s right to freedom of expression and of the press, following the politically-motivated cyber-libel cases filed against news site Rappler and the cyber-attacks being launched against alternative news websites such as Bulatlat.</p>
<p><strong>A repeat of glorious days</strong></p>
<p>Survivors of the martial law years who joined the protest action today reminisced the &#8220;glorious days&#8221; that led to the downfall of the conjugal Marcos dictatorship.</p>
<p>Lawyer Aleta Tolentino of People Power Volunteers for Reform pointed out that senators implicated in the infamous pork barrel scam are now free from charges.</p>
<p>She said, &#8220;<em>ibalik ang ninakaw. Hindi ang magnanakaw</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the election fast approaches, Bayan said there are various indications that the Duterte administration “is intent on using the vast machinery and resources of the state to push for the victory of its candidates in the 2019 polls.”</p>
<p>The group said, “the people will not allow and will resist a repeat of the Marcos dictatorship under the signboard of ‘Duterte.’ Our mass actions today are a demonstration of unity by various groups and democratic forces who have not forgotten the lessons of EDSA and are determined to fulfill the people’s aspirations for genuine freedom and democracy.” <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>“His death is a reminder that we should fight for what is right.”</p>
<p><strong>By SHEERAH ESCUDERO </strong><br />
<em><a href="http://bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA &#8212; “To serve the people selflessly is glorious.”</p>
<p>These were the words of slain peace consultant Felix Randy Malayao that will forever be etched in the hearts and minds of human rights defenders and peace advocates who recently gathered to pay tribute to him on Feb. 19 at the Institute of Biology in the University of the Philippines..</p>
<p>Malayao, the youngest peace consultant of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) in its peace negotiation with the Philippine government, was killed in the wee hours of Jan. 30 while sleeping on a bus en route to his hometown.</p>
<p>In their speeches, they shared narratives on how they met Malayao, offered songs and poems on how he lived his life, more than 30 years of which he offered to the Filipino people’s movement for genuine and lasting peace.</p>
<p>Malayao, who was supposedly covered by a peace agreement that provides immunity to arrests, surveillance, and attacks such as this, is the second peace consultant killed. NDFP peace consultant Sotero Llamas was killed back in 2006.</p>
<p><strong>Leader and peace maker</strong></p>
<p>His colleagues from the Taripnong-Cagayan Valley described Malayao as a person who was molded by the oppressed people he has chosen to serve. Jeffrey Mancera of Taripnong stressed that it would have been easy for Malayao to choose a more simple life. But it was impossible to not to heed the calls of the people.</p>
<p>“He sees everyone equally. Perhaps, this is why he became a peace and human rights advocate,” said a fellow UP Diliman Beta Sigma Fraternity member.</p>
<p>Malayao, a hands-on leader, was known for his tireless service and positive outlook, even during difficult times as pointed out by a fellow alumnus of the College Editors Guild of the Philippines, Teddy Casiño. He also noted that the slain peace consultant was “great in alliance building with people regardless of political party affiliation, even the rival parties.”</p>
<p>Malayao served as Regional Coordinator of Bayan Muna in Cagayan Valley in 2013, vice president for Luzon of Makabayan Coalition and regional coordinator of Bayan Muna in Cagayan Valley this year.</p>
<p><strong>On continuing the fight</strong></p>
<p>Malayao’s childhood friend and journalist Raymond Villanueva said tributes such as this will only glorify the memories of the departed if those who are present will continue the fight that they have started.</p>
<p>“His death is a reminder that we should fight for what is right,” Malayao’s Beta Sigma frat member added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Renato Reyes of Bayan emphasized that the first step for justice is to identify who is behind Malayao’s killing. He also assailed the present stance of the Duterte administration that those behind his killing are revolutionary forces seeking retribution.</p>
<p>He challenged those present to ensure that the incident, the killing of Malayao, will be known not just in the Philippines but also internationally.<a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>“If we recall, during the Marcos dictatorship, the first thing he did was to suppress the media.</p>
<p><strong>By ALYSSA MAE CLARIN</strong><br />
<em><a href="http://bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA &#8212; Youth groups and students from the Polytechnic University of the Philippines marched out of their classes to join a Unity March calling for press freedom, democracy, justice and human rights on February 21 at the Freedom Park, PUP Mabini Campus.</p>
<p>“It is the duty of the media to report and become the voice of the people, the minority, the workers who are being forced to be blinded, and forced to be silenced by the Duterte administration,” said Guia Sanchez, the current editor-in-chief of the progressive student publication The Catalyst.</p>
<p>Recently, the issue of press freedom in the country has been brought to the fore, following the cyberlibel charges filed against Rappler’s chief Maria Ressa and the the cyber-attacks being launched against independent and alternative news websites such as Bulatlat, Pinoy Weekly, Kodao Productions, and AlterMidya People’s Media Network.</p>
<p>Along with fellow progressive groups, Alyansa ng Kabataang Mamamahayag, the broadest and only alliance of student publications in the whole PUP system, joined the Unity March to call for a stop to the political persecutions against the media.</p>
<p>“It is very reminiscent,” Sanchez said on why the fight for press freedom is important, adding that “if we recall, during the Marcos dictatorship, the first thing he did was to suppress the media. As we can see, there’s no difference from then and now.”</p>
<p>The student journalist also pointed out the red-tagging of journalists late last year and the killings among the ranks of news media practitioners.</p>
<p><strong>Campus journalism also under attack</strong></p>
<p>The attempts to curtail press freedom in the country, Sanchez said, do not spare student journalists.</p>
<p>“Every year, there’s a growing number of publications dying under the university because of the loss of funding and facilities,” said Sanchez.</p>
<p>The Catalyst, as well as other student publications in PUP, are experiencing mass defunding causing student publications to be ejected from their offices and their papers to stop publishing.</p>
<p><strong>Youth’s contribution</strong></p>
<p>Sanchez pointed out that the youth played a significant part in ousting the Marcos dictatorship, as seen during the First Quarter Storm. The youth of today, she added, could do the same and spark change.</p>
<p>“As they say, history repeats itself. It is possible for the youth of today to replicate what had happened during the First Quarter Storm,” she said, adding that the youth has a voice that helps shape public opinion and enlighten those who are in need.</p>
<p>Contrary to the infamous proposal of National Youth Commission chair Ronald Cardema to remove the scholarships of so-called “rebellious students,” Sanchez pointed out that the rights we enjoy today are “fruits of student activists’ collective actions.”</p>
<p>She added, “Us, the youth, should always be hopeful. Hope that with out collective actions, we would inspire change.” <a href="http://bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="http://bulatlat.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(http://bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>MANILA &#8212; The family and friends of missing activist Jonas Burgos said they have been insulted by the Philippine government’s motion to remove from official international records 625 cases of enforced disappearances.</p>
<p>On Feb. 14, the Presidential Human Rights Committee formally moved for the delisting of the cases during a meeting with the United Nations Working Group on Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances in Sarajevo, according to a <a href="https://dfa.gov.ph/dfa-news/dfa-releasesupdate/19397-ph-in-process-of-delisting-cases-of-involuntary-disappearances">press release</a> by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>The list includes the disappearance of Jonas Burgos, who was abducted by suspected state security forces on April 28, 2007 in Quezon City.</p>
<p>In a statement, Free Jonas Burgos Movement said, “This proposed delisting is an insult. It is disrespectful: totally disregarding and dismissing the suffering of the families of all the missing. It is an attack against all of us who continue to be uncertain about the fate and whereabouts of our relatives.”</p>
<p>The family has this message for the Philippine government, &#8220;You took Jonas away from us. Now, you want the history of Jonas’ own abduction and disappearance erased from history. Stop abducting your own citizens. The ones who should be made to pay for the violations are the very criminals within your ranks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Secretariat of the PHRC Undersecretary Severo Catura reasoned out that domestic mechanisms are being implemented to resolve the cases, citing the Anti-Enforced or Involuntary Disappearance Law of 2012 (R.A. 10353) and <a href="https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2012/11/22/administrative-order-no-35-s-2012/">Administrative Order 35</a>, or the creation of Inter-agency Committee on Extra-legal Killings, Enforced Disappearances, torture and other grave violations of the right to life, liberty and security of persons.</p>
<p>In reaction, Free Jonas Burgos Movement said, “These are total lies. If these mechanisms indeed work, why has the Duterte regime promoted General Eduardo Año – one of the suspects in Jonas’ abduction—to a prominent Cabinet position as the current Secretary of the Department of Interior and Local Government? Are the so-called mechanisms designed to reward, exalt, and promote the abductors and masterminds instead of bringing them to justice?”</p>

<p>The Jonas Burgos case, one of the high-profile cases of enforced disappearances, resulted in the acquittal of all the military suspects named in the complaint. On Oct. 12, 2017, the Army major identified by witnesses in the abduction was absolved by the court.</p>
<p>Jonas’s family is asking the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances to visit the country and investigate the cases.</p>
<p>“We went to your office because all legal remedies inside the country have failed. We want you to intervene in the search for justice for these crimes against the Filipino people. Heed our plea: listen to the agony of the victims’ call for justice,” they said.</p>
<p>They added that enforced disappearances and other cases of human rights violations continue to happen under the Duterte administration.</p>
<p>The Burgos family vowed not to stop until justice is served and Jonas is brought back home.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Farmers denounced President Rodrigo Duterte for signing the rice tariffication bill into law last Feb. 15.The law removes the quantitative restrictions on the importation of rice and imposes tariffs on rice imports. </p>
<p>The Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (KMP)  said the law “is equivalent to a death sentence for the local rice industry and rice farmers.” </p>
<p>KMP said the law will directly affect 13.5 million palay farmers and their families, 17.5 million farm workers, and more than 10 million Filipinos dependent on NFA rice, 20,000 rice retailers and 55,000 rice mill workers. </p>
<p>Under the law, National Food Authority  will no longer supply low-priced rice to the local market. Government’s rice buffer stock will only be for emergency and disaster relief. The average volume of NFA rice for disaster relief operations is about 30,000 metric tons or 600,000 bags a year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the NFA will no longer maintain stock for stabilization of supply and price at the consumer level especially during lean months.</p>
<p>Danilo Ramos, KMP chairperson, said in a statement, “It&#8217;s the beginning of the end of the local rice industry. Even with the rice industry enhancement fund, the local rice industry do not stand a chance with massive rice imports.”</p>
<p>Ramos said the country’s decades of experience under the World Trade Organization proved that rice importation policy was never a guarantee of sufficient rice supply and lower rice prices.  </p>
<p>According to Ibon Foundation, from 2008 to 2010, the country imported an annual average of 2.2 million metric tons of rice but the price continued to increase at an annual average of P1.20 per kilo until 2016.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, rice watch group Bantay Bigas and the peasant women group Amihan or the National Federation of Peasant women said the law will destroy the country’s self-sufficiency and self-reliance for food. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Anakpawis Partylist Rep. Ariel Casilao vowed to file a bill for the repeal of the law on the date it shall take effect. </p>
<p>Relying on rice imports, he said, is contrary to food security.</p>
<p>“The law is a tombstone for the Philippine rice industry, and will be buried to death, the livelihood and welfare of 2.4 million rice farmers and more farm workers…” Casilao said.<br />
 <br />
He added that the law will undermine the P350 billion &#8211; 19 million metric ton &#8211; palay sector. “This is clearly betrayal of the people&#8217;s and national interest,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Casilao warned that Duterte will earn the fury of tens of millions of rice stakeholders, including the poor consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hunger, poverty, death, will be the only legacies the poor will remember about this regime,” he said. </p>
<p>Casilao has been pushing for “an authentic rice industry development program” to solve the chronic rice crisis in the country. He is the author of the House Bill No. 8512 Rice Industry Development Act bill and HB 555 Genuine Agrarian Reform Bill (GARB).</p>
