				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MANILA — Progressive media outfit <em>Bulatlat</em> was one of the finalists in the photography category of the 2016 Save the Children Media Awards.  </p>
<p>Janess Ann J. Ellao’s photograph of a mother and her child taken after a violent demolition in sitio San Roque, Quezon City made it to the top ten. Titled “Without a roof,” a girl seems unfazed as she eats her lunch along a busy road right across where her family’s home once stood. </p>
<p>The awarding ceremonies were held Nov. 29 at the Bahay ng Alumni, University of the Philippines Diliman.  </p>
<p>Ellao said her entry is “my humble contribution in portraying how children are greatly affected by supposed development projects that, in reality, deprive them of their basic right to shelter and their parents of their livelihood.” “It is in this light that we should see how the children&#8217;s plight &#8212; including their health and well-being &#8212; should be reported,” she said.  </p>
<p>Sitio San Roque is a part of the Quezon City Central Business District, a joint venture between the National Housing Authority and Ayala Land. The 250-hectare project aims to develop the area into a prime property at the center of Quezon City through constructing commercial and residential units. It, however, currently serves as home to some 20,000 urban poor families.  </p>
<p>Ellao said <em>Bulatlat</em> has always been at the forefront in providing a human face to the everyday struggles of many Filipinos.  </p>
<p>Ellao has been covering the urban poor beat since she became a reporter at <em>Bulatlat</em> in 2009.  </p>
<p>Rafael Lerma won the Most Outstanding Photograph with his entry “Hungry Kids” while Mark Baltazar Saludes’s “Food Securtiy: A Daily Struggle” won the People’s Choice Award in the same category.  </p>
<p>Other finalists were Gil Cruz Jr., Migurel Antonio de Guzman, Corona Dolot, Alfredo Bullit Marquez, Jojo Rinoza, Dennis Sabangan and Business World.   </p>
<p>Freelance writer Karen Rivera grabbed the Most Outstanding Article with her story highlighting the problem of malnutrition in an isolated and conflict-affected community in Lanao del Sur.  </p>
<p>Bandila’s “Mga Kaso ng malnutrition, tumaas” won the Most Outstanding Special Feature while Investigative Documentaries’s “Extra Rice” was adjudged as Most Outstanding Short Film.  </p>
<p>Reel Time’s full-length documentary “Sawat” was given a Special Citation.  </p>
<p>The media awards is part of the Save the Children’s “Lahat Dapat” campaign, the group’s biggest campaign yet against child hunger and malnutrition.  </p>
<p>Ned Olney, country director of Save the Children Philippines, thanked the journalists who joined the competition for their hard work and commitment in helping address hunger and malnutrition in the Philippines.<a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA &#8212; <em>Bulatlat.com</em> was cited by students of St. Scholastica’s College for its report in the implementation of the law protecting the rights and welfare of women. </p>
<p>The report titled, <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2014/10/15/more-gaps-than-gains-anti-women-portrayals-practices-continue-despite-magna-carta-of-women/">“More gaps than gains? | Anti-women portrayals, practices continue despite Magna Carta of Women,”</a> written by Anne Ednalyn dela Cruz, received an award for Outstanding Achievements in Online Journalism. </p>
<p>The 9th Hildegarde Awards for Women in Media and Communication is named after St. Hildegarde of Bingen of Germany, a celebrated Benedictine nun. St. Hildegarde, who was considered a woman ahead of her time, was a counselor, linguist, naturalist, philosopher, physician, herbalist, poet, visionary and a composer.  </p>
<p>Dela Cruz is the first graduate of the Mass Communication Department of St. Scholastica’s College &#8211; Manila ever to receive an award.  </p>

<p>Dela Cruz’s story was also cited in the 18th Graciano Lopez Jaena Community Journalism Workshop of the University of the Philippines – College of Mass Communication in 2014.</p>
<p>Dela Cruz urged her fellow Scholasticans “to serve the people and write for the people.”</p>

<p><strong>Impact of armed conflict on children highlighted</strong></p>
<p>In a statement, the ICRC said the winners of this year’s award highlighted the plight of children caught in armed conflict areas. “Batang Halau,” for one, which bagged the first place for the video category, documented the stories of “stateless” children born in Sabah to Filipino parents.</p>
<p>“Their stories and images illustrated the heavy toll of conflicts on civilians – with some looking through the eyes of children who are the more vulnerable in these situations. All the finalists showed that reporting on conflict need not be sensationalized or focused only on the conflict or on the peace negotiations,” Pascal Mauchle, ICRC head of delegation to the Philippines, said.</p>
<p>Del Rosario, the producer of “Batang Halau,” told <em>Bulatlat.com</em> he had a hard time pitching the story to his mother network, saying that they had to factor in the safety of the crew, budget for filming the documentary and if it would rate.</p>
<p>He added that most reports focus on the parents, who escaped the hard life and the trauma brought about by the armed conflict in Mindanao. They sailed to Sabah hoping to find better livelihood and away from war. Their children, however, being “stateless” do not have birth certificates and, as a result, could not avail of schooling from the Malaysian government.</p>
<p>Del Rosario said that since they could not go to school, children either end up as workers in vast plantations in Sabah or sent to jail and then deported back to the Philippines.</p>
<p>“I am happy. The award is just a bonus. Our main aim is to provide awareness and to open the issue for public discussion,” he said.</p>
<p>“Strides into the future” told the story of Norjaida, who, at three months old, lost her leg in an ambush in Northern Mindanao while “Child in red blanket” showed a father carrying his child, wrapped in a red blanket as he and other families were fleeing from an armed encounter between government troops and members of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters last year.</p>
<p>The entries of <em>Bulatlat.com</em>, too, focused on children. The video, “Killings unabated under Aquino” told the story of Lourdes Mancera and how he lost her husband and two children when soldiers peppered their home in Camarines Norte with bullets, believing they were protecting members of the New People’s Army.</p>
<p>“Child rights violations under Aquino government increasing,” on the other hand, reported not just the dangers that children in armed conflict areas go through but also the violations of their socio-economic rights.</p>
<p>The report read, “In the ideal world, children are supposed to be protected from harm and are able to enjoy basic social services such as education and health services. In the ideal world, children are not supposed to die of hunger; they should have a roof over their heads and are living in a safe secure environment; they do not have to work to augment their families’ income. But none of these happen in the real world.”</p>
<p>This is the second time that the Red Cross Award for Humanitarian Reporting recognized the reports published in <em>Bulatlat.com</em>. During its first awarding in 2011, the alternative news agency won the online category&#8217;s first and second place for &#8220;Child rights advocates bewail distortion of child protection for counterinsurgency&#8221; and &#8220;Child soldiers or victims,&#8221; respectively.</p>
<p>Olea said, “Despite our modest resources, we will continue to produce videos and write articles about stories and issues that the public should know about.” <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

It bested mainstream media outlets for the awards, which was established last year “to promote responsible reporting of conflict situations by highlighting the plight of those affected by it.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>By JANESS ANN J. ELLAO</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com </a></em></p>
<p>MANILA – Bulatlat.com dominated the online category in the first Red Cross Award for Humanitarian Reporting held on Saturday, May 7, winning the first and second prizes for stories that tackle the plight of children caught in conflict.</p>
<p>The alternative online publication bested mainstream media outlets for the award, which was established last year “to promote responsible reporting of conflict situations by highlighting the plight of those affected by it.” The awarding ceremonies were held on Saturday at the Richmonde Hotel in Ortigas, Pasig City.</p>
<p>Bulatlat.com staff writer Marya Salamat won the first prize for her story <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2010/11/20/child-rights-advocates-bewail-distortion-of-child-protection-principles-for-counter-insurgency/">“Child rights advocates bewail distortion of child protection principles for counterinsurgency</a>,” published on Nov. 20, 2010. The story tackled the practice by the military of labeling as “child combatants”  children caught in armed conflict,  often using so-called child-protection instrumentalities such as the <a href="http://www.un.org/children/conflict/english/parisprinciples.html">Paris Principle</a> to justify the practice.</p>
<p>Quoting the nongovernment Children’s Rehabilitation Center, Salamat wrote that the Philippine military has been “distorting the intent of the international children’s protection principle to suit its counter-insurgency operations and violate human and children’s rights in the process.”</p>

(bulatlat.com) </em> </span></div>
<p>Another Bulatlat.com staff writer, Ina Alleco Silverio, won the second prize  in the same category for the story “<a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2011/03/05/child-soldiers-or-victims/">Child soldiers or victims?</a>” published on Feb. 6, 2011. The story discusses the impact of <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/category/humanrights/">extrajudicial killings</a> on the children the victims left behind, as well as on children who have been victims themselves.</p>
<p>“Their brutal killing at the hands of the military prove the extent of the AFP’s impunity — not even the most innocent are spared,” Silverio wrote.</p>
<p>Staff writers Ronalyn V.  Olea, Anne Marxze Umil and Janess Ann J. Ellao were also shortlisted in the competition. Last month, <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2011/03/09/bulatlat-cited-for-its-coverage-of-women%e2%80%99s-issues/">Umil was awarded a special citation</a> by St. Scholastica College’s Hildegarde Awards for Women in Media for her stories on women and children.</p>
<p>Bulatlat.com is one of only two media outlets that won at least two major awards; the other is the Philippine Daily Inquirer. It also tied with the Inquirer in having the most number of finalists – five &#8212; in any of the categories.</p>
<p>The third prize in the online category went to Andreo Calonzo of GMANews Online for the story “A year after Ampatuan massacre, local journalists struggle to stay safe” published on Nov. 19, 2010.</p>
<p>The Philippine Red Cross and the International Committee of the Red Cross launched the journalism awards in August last year, in partnership with the International News Safety Institute, Peace and Conflict Journalism Network, Philippine Association of Communication Educators and the Rotary Club of Manila.</p>

<p>  Richard Gordon, former senator and chairman of the Philippine Red Cross, said in his speech Saturday that through this award, the Philippine Red Cross hopes that more news reports on the impact of armed conflict would be reported in the media. “It’s about time that we put this on the front page,” he said.</p>
<p>The Red Cross Award for Humanitarian Reporting received some 60 entries from online, print, radio and television news media agencies. The entries were judged according to the quality of the research, sourcing, coherence, style of writing and &#8220;conflict-sensitive reporting.&#8221;</p>

<p>  Today, Feb. 7, Bulatlat marks its 10th anniversary. While we have every reason to celebrate this occasion, it is important to point out that the conditions that we set out to chronicle a decade ago that were, in fact, our <em>raison d'être</em> -- economic backwardness, human-rights abuses, landlessness, political persecution,  corruption, to name a few -- still persist. That said, here's to the next 10 years -- and beyond!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Today, Bulatlat marks its 10th anniversary. While we have every reason to celebrate this occasion &#8212; we have, after all, created a niche in the Philippine press through our own brand of incisive and progressive journalism &#8212; it is important to point out that the conditions that we set out to chronicle a decade ago that were, in fact, our <em>raison d&#8217;être</em> &#8212; economic backwardness, human-rights abuses, landlessness, political persecution,  corruption, to name a few &#8212; still persist. That said, here&#8217;s to the next 10 years &#8212; and beyond!</strong></p>
<p><strong>By BENJIE OLIVEROS</strong><br />
 <em> <a href="http://www.bulatlat.com/">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<div style="width: 200px; height:200px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 5px"><img style="width: 200px; height: 200px; border: solid 1px #9A9A9A" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/02072011_bulatlat10.jpg"></div>
<p>   MANILA &#8212; The Estrada impeachment hearing in 2001 was dubbed as the most popular, most watched telenovela during that time.  This was reflective of the highly politicized atmosphere then. It also indicated that 15 years after People Power I in 1986 , the Filipino people once again felt the need to engage in direct political action to effect change.  This was not surprising. </p>
<p>After the Marcos dictatorship was ousted from power, there was much hope that democracy would reign, social justice would be achieved, prosperity would follow, and the Filipino people would finally benefit from the country&#8217;s wealth and natural resources.  But apart from the restoration of the people&#8217;s formal democratic rights, the release of political prisoners and the framing of the 1987 Constitution, which adopted international human rights laws, conventions, and principles, the Cory Aquino administration was marked by a series of coups d&#8217;état that made sure that the government drifted to the right; a bloody counterinsurgency campaign that resulted in two massacres (the Mendiola and Lupao massacres), the displacement of millions of peasants, an unprecedented number of victims of enforced disappearances, and the wanton display of brutality by paramilitary units (a photo of two members of a paramilitary unit holding the head of one of its victims graced the cover of a magazine, which was published by a human-rights organization.) </p>
<p>When a former general, Fidel V. Ramos, took over the reins of government in a hotly contested presidential election in 1992, the Filipino people began to hope once more.  Ramos provided a vision of a country taking off from conditions of backwardness and widespread poverty.  He fast-tracked the local implementation of the globalization project, opening up the country to foreign trade and investments.  The Ramos administration auctioned off government-owned and -controlled corporations, thereby generating revenues for the government.  However, after the government sold most of its valuable assets to foreign investors and their local partners, and when Southeast Asia was hit by a financial crisis that was triggered by capital flight, the illusions of a prospering economy disappeared.   </p>
<p>Thus, the people pinned their hopes on Joseph Ejercito Estrada who projected himself as a champion of the masses. However, his administration was cut short by a people fed up with the brazen display of corruption and ostentatious living amid the worsening poverty. The Filipino people&#8217;s yearning for change was once again concretized by direct political action.</p>
<p>The period during and immediately after People Power II in 2001 was an opportune time to discuss issues and problems that confronted the Filipino people after the dictatorship was toppled. Why is life even more difficult for the Filipino people 15 years after the dictatorship?  Why is another People Power uprising necessary? What are its limitations?  Who was to replace Estrada, especially since the vice president then, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, was not very popular?  The political atmosphere of the time was  fertile ground to discuss not only why change did not come about after 15 years but also the path toward and the imperatives of change that would genuinely benefit the Filipino people.   </p>
<p>At the same time, a new medium had been opened up for advocacy on issues: the Internet.  The second People Power uprising, which toppled the Estrada administration, demonstrated how technology, in this case text messaging, could be used to mobilize people.  But the Internet was still underutilized then. The &#8220;high technology&#8221; bubble in the US had burst by then and closures and retrenchments had doomed Silicon Valley, but in the Philippines, the Internet was just beginning to become popular.</p>
<p>Thus, <em>Bulatlat</em> was conceived and launched barely two weeks after Estrada stepped down from power and Arroyo assumed the presidency. </p>
<p>Arroyo turned out to be much worse than her predecessors.  The Arroyo administration was the best example of the limitations of a People Power uprising and was the best argument for the need for thoroughgoing change.  It demonstrated that a mere change in the people holding positions in government is not enough.  Elite politics and rule was at its worst under the Arroyo regime. The corruption, the debasement of democratic processes, and the gross human-rights violations were second only to the Marcos dictatorship. Not only that, the economic crisis and the widespread poverty further worsened.</p>
<p>Amid all these, <em>Bulatlat</em> found and developed its niche in an industry dominated by media conglomerates.  <em>Bulatlat</em> did not merely write about the numerous corruption scandals being exposed left and right &#8212; it explained why corruption is endemic in elite rule and politics in the context of the country&#8217;s backwardness.  It did not just write about the spike in human-rights violations, especially extrajudicial killings and enforced disappearances &#8212; it explained how the Arroyo administration, which was desperately clinging to power, was using all the institutions of government for its self-serving ends, making numeorus attempts to curtail civil liberties and was attacking those who were fighting its rule.  <em>Bulatlat</em> traced the trail of blood to its roots: Oplan Bantay Laya, the Arroyo government&#8217;s bloody counterinsurgency program, and dicussed the role of the United States, which, while perfunctorily condemning the extrajudicial killings in the Philippines, was advising, aiding, and arming the Armed Forces of the Philippines and was conducting preemptive strikes, political renditions and assassinations, and using torture around the world under the guise of its &#8220;war on terror.&#8221; </p>
<p>Furthermore, <em>Bulatlat</em> provided a face to every victim of human-rights violation. It chronicled the lives of the victims, their contributions to the defense of the people&#8217;s rights and to the struggle for change. It described the impact of the killing or abduction to the families of the victims and how their death or disappearance serves not to cow but to inspire his or her colleagues in the progressive movement.  </p>
<p>In discussing the economic crisis and the worsening poverty, <em>Bulatlat</em> did not just cite macroenconic data such as the Gross National Product or Gross Domestic Product, the behavior of the stock market, and the value of the peso &#8212; it discussed the roots of the crisis, the failure of globalization and its concomitant policies of liberalization, deregulation, and privatization, and the need for a radical reorientation and restructuring of the economy.  <em>Bulatlat</em> thoroughly discussed the impact of these globalization policies on the different sectors: the peasants, workers, migrant workers, urban poor, women and children, youth and students, national minority peoples, as well as its impact on the environment and the rights of the Filipino people. </p>
<p><em>Bulatlat</em> discussed the question of sovereignty, or the lack of it &#8212;  the IMF-WB impositions, how multinational corporations extract profits by exploiting Filipino workers and raping the country&#8217;s natural resources while getting numerous incentives from the government, and how the increasing US intervention in the country&#8217;s affairs and the continuous presence of US troops in the country ensure that the national government does not veer away from the agenda and policies of imperialist globalization. </p>
<p><em>Bulatlat</em> also strived to provide a human face to the worsening poverty in the country so that the discourse would not be limited to policy questions and theoretical constucts.  </p>
<p><em>Bulatlat</em> sought to propagate a  people&#8217;s culture and an alternative view to world events by publishing the works of progressive artists and writers, journalists and political analysts.  </p>
<p>And to give the readers a better perspective of the issues and the lives of the Filipino people, to give flesh and blood to the stories, and to expand the reach and impact of its articles, <em>Bulatlat</em>, in 2009, began utilizing the tools of multimedia and the reach of social-networking sites. </p>
<p>The nine years of the Arroyo administration tested the mettle of <em>Bulatlat</em>.  And <em>Bulatlat</em> has grown from an organization with three volunteer writers-editors publishing around three new articles per week to what it is now: still comprised of less than 10 volunteer staff but publishing around 20 new articles per week. Its reach expanded from a few hundred unique visitors a month to tens of thousands a month.</p>
<p>The task that <em>Bulatlat</em> committed to did not end with the promises of change by the current administration of President Benigno S. Aquino III.  In fact, behind the lofty promises and the strongly worded rhetoric, there are no indications that the current Aquino administration would veer away from the path that was pursued by the Arroyo administration.  It is implementing the same economic policies, which are consistent with the failed globalization project. It has been following the same IMF-WB dictates and the same agenda being pushed by the US, including the strengthened presence of US troops in the country. Extrajudicial killings and other human-rights violations are continuing and justice for the victims remains elusive. Beyond the tough talk and the numerous exposes of corruption involving key officials of the previous Arroyo administration, the Aquino administration has not shown political will in holding Arroyo, her family and her cronies accountable for their numerous crimes against the Filipino people.

<p>In the years to come, <em>Bulatlat</em> would continue doing what it does best: publish incisive articles on issues by taking the perspective of the majority of the Filipino people while conforming to the highest standards of responsible journalism. <em>Bulatlat</em> would strive to make its articles better by integrating more multimedia tools. In the final analysis, the gauge of <em>Bulatlat&#8217;s</em> effectiveness is in the dissemination of its advocacies and its contribution to the public&#8217;s understanding of the issues confronting the Filipino people and the appreciation of the need for meaningful change.  <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16"></a></p>
