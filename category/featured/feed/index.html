Salamat / Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure>
<p>MANILA &#8212; Two proofs stand out today showing<a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2014/10/01/we-will-not-be-wiped-out-by-dams/"> how long and how determined </a>the people of Sierra Madre have defended its rivers from private mega-dam projects. One, over the years, they have generated what’s shaping up into a soundtrack of the indigenous people’s defense of the rivers and forested ancestral lands in Rizal and Quezon. Two, they have leaders and organizers of environmental defenders today who were youth activists or kids going with their parents in protest actions of the past.</p>
<p>A Dumagat spokesperson of <em>Imaset</em>, Wilma Quierrez, is one of such leaders. As early as when she was six months old, her mother was organizing the Dumagat seeking to stop<a href="https://ejatlas.org/conflict/laiban-dam-new-centennial-water-source-project-ncws-quezon-philippines"> the Laiban dam project </a>then of the Marcos administration.</p>
<p>Wilma grew up watching her mother, Marilyn Quierrez, working actively for the cause. She is grateful to her mother. “She raised me mindful of the plight of the indigenous people, of our right to self-determination, and inextricably linked to that, the need to protect the environment.” As a child she had gone to rallies with her mother.</p>
<p>With her are <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2014/09/27/second-generation-of-activists-continue-fight-against-laiban-dam/">other second-generation defenders of the environment</a>, like Lodima Doroteo, who recalls having joined protests with her grandfather in the 90s. She is now in her early 20s and also active in continuing the Dumagat elders’ defense of the river and forests.</p>
<figure id="attachment_105737" style="width: 700px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-105737" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dumagat_young_woman_tothe_gates_DL.jpg" alt="Laiban Kaliwa Kanan New Centennial dam projects" width="700" height="525" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dumagat_young_woman_tothe_gates_DL.jpg 700w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/dumagat_young_woman_tothe_gates_DL-487x365.jpg 487w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">One of the second-generation opponents of the (repackaged) dam project stands before the gates of the stalled Laiban Dam project by the river in Tanay, Rizal. (Photo by M. Salamat / Bulatlat.com)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2016/08/15/sons-slain-dumagat-leader-harassed-soldiers/">children of Nicanor delos Santos are also actively uniting calls </a>to continue defending the rivers from the renewed drive to dam big parts of it under different names. Nicanor delos Santos was the Dumagat leading the tribe&#8217;s opposition to Laiban Dam when he was murdered at the beginning of former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo&#8217;s term.</p>
<p>Delos Santos&#8217; murder did not stop the struggle which eventually succeeded in stopping the project again.</p>
<p>One of his sons, Arnel, said the government has repackaged the Laiban dam project, calling it the New Centennial or Kaliwa or Kanan dams, &#8220;because the Laiban Dam project has been thoroughly rejected by the people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilma herself seems to be passing on the tradition to her children. A breastfeeding mom, wherever she goes her youngest son is in tow. Her son goes with her in forum, mass delegation and lobbying, street rallies, or conferences. Wilma could be seen carrying her son sometimes even on stage when she’s addressing the public.</p>
<p>Wilma’s mother passed away 10 years ago at the age of 48. “It’s very hard to no longer have your mother with you,” the daughter admits. She’s intent on continuing what her mother helped her realize needs doing. She’s being like her, she said. While active at campaigns for saving the river and the forest, Wilma’s mother had also worked to bring food to the table. Like her, Wilma is also a farmer. She works the land with her husband, and that they are both raising their children consciously avoiding the feudal mindset – they are seeking equality and both strive to respect and support each other at work, at home and in the struggle against dislocation from their ancestral land.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/10/13/dumagats-advocates-urge-public-to-be-mindful-of-protecting-sierra-madre/">need to protect the forest and its river </a>as well as their right to ancestral domain and self-determination has prompted both the Dumagat men and women to act. They also seem to have arrived at a setup they can best work with.</p>
<p>The men handle the heavier work or stay longer in the fields; the women who also work at the field also find the time not just to attend to their homes, children and selling or storing their produce, but to also attend to building community, unity and spreading the news with other Dumagat, Remontado and others who would be adversely affected by the dam projects.</p>
<figure id="attachment_105732" style="width: 788px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-105732" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/imaset_flag_DL.jpg" alt="Imaset" width="788" height="530" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/imaset_flag_DL.jpg 788w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/imaset_flag_DL-543x365.jpg 543w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/imaset_flag_DL-768x517.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/imaset_flag_DL-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">This is the flag of Imaset, the Dumagat women&#8217;s organization working to save the environment and the Sierra Madre from destructive projects.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Last August 3 to 4, Wilma and other Dumagat women established <em>Imaset</em>, the Dumagat and Remontado women’s assembly.</p>
<p><em>Imaset</em> means the people uniting the “Kadumagetan” or the indigenous peoples of Sierra Madre uniting against exploitation and oppression. This, to them, is exemplified by “development aggression” inherent in the dam projects, and what they described as false ‘national greening program.’</p>
<p>After forming <em>Imaset</em>, the women worked to establish a network of broad supporters to the call to save the Quezon and Rizal river and the Sierra Madre. In the first week of October, they formed such a network from a college in Metro Manila.</p>
<p>They also launched their new song, another contribution on top of another Dumagat song popularized in the Laiban dam struggle since the 80s.</p>
<figure id="attachment_105733" style="width: 653px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-105733" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/notoNCWS_launch_DL.jpg" alt="Network Opposed to NCWSP" width="653" height="490" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/notoNCWS_launch_DL.jpg 653w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/notoNCWS_launch_DL-486x365.jpg 486w" sizes="(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">At the launch of Network Opposed to New Centennial Water Source Project, women and other supporters mark their vow to oppose the new dam projects.</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Singing, dancing in prayer for people’s unity to save the environment</strong></p>
<p>What is remarkable among the Dumagat is their affinity to music and dance. On the day they formed Imaset, their workshop produced the text to a new song also entitled “<em>Imaset</em>.” Supportive priest Alex Bercasio composed the music to accompany the text and in playing it with the Dumagat, the community singing invariably led to the <em>Imaset</em> dance.</p>
<p>In the song, they pour their calls to each other and to the public, in alternate Filipino and Dumagat, literally telling everyone: “Defend the ancestral land; bolster our ranks, defeat the projects of the oppressors; we are not afraid, we are united; and defend Sierra Madre.”</p>
<p>The <em>Imaset</em> theme song is now being introduced to urban listeners and supporters as one of the songs of a group called Reds Pangkat Sining. The name is newly coined, but the priests and other musicians comprising it have long been supportive of the Dumagat&#8217;s struggle.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-105741" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/imasetdance1.jpg" alt="Imaset dance" width="736" height="403" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/imasetdance1.jpg 736w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/imasetdance1-660x361.jpg 660w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/imasetdance1-180x100.jpg 180w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" /></p>
<p>If the Dumagat have second generation activists joining the elders now, they and their supporters also have new songs to accompany it. The <em>Imaset</em> theme song is another product of this generation’s struggle to save anew the Sierra Madre rivers and forest. From the time the Dumagat were opposing the Laiban dam project, priests such as Fr Oliver Castor had immersed with the Dumagat and from that composed the song entitled “Un Potok.”</p>
<p><em>Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dajOvBL9ZPQ">a version of Un Potok on Youtube,</a> as recorded by the Talahib People’s Music. </em></p>
<p><em>Here, too, is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYx5Mz7who4">a version of Un Potok featuring Fr Oliver and the Dumagat women</a>. This is how they usually sing it in communities, accompanied only by one or two ukulele and any available indigenous percussion instruments:</em></p>
<p>“Un Potok” (The Land) is a song on the indigenous Dumagat praying to their god, Makijapat, asking why the natural resources and the fertile lands are to be submerged and taken away from the people just for the profit of a few, and why the lush forest had to be denuded. Written by Fr Oliver Castor in 1985 and revised up to 1989, it’s been a unifying song whenever the Dumagat and supporters for the defense of Sierra Madre and the environment were gathered.</p>
<p>Castor said he wrote the song inspired by a folk song of the Dumagat children of Gen. Nakar, Quezon. In 1985 he wrote that he had a young friend &#8220;who was imprisoned and tortured until he died in the hands of the fascist military.&#8221;</p>
<p>For years, only the Dumagat knew the song &#8220;Un Potok&#8221; was his composition. With the Duterte government’s drive to revive the dam projects, Un Potok reverberates once more, and Fr Castor has amped up also the way they sing Un Potok.</p>
<p>Now, add to Un Potok is <em>Imaset</em>, their latest crowd-drawing Dumagat song for unity. It is encouraging friends and allies to the dance floor, to join the Dumagat and other indigenous peoples in various gatherings.</p>
<p>The Dumagat especially the women first sang together the <em>Imaset</em> during the solidarity night and bonfire of the Dumagat women’s assembly. They made a circle and declared their unity through the song.</p>
<figure id="attachment_105739" style="width: 577px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-105739" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/20181006_imaset_dance_athelaunch_NOtoNCWS.jpg" alt="NCWS" width="577" height="433" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/20181006_imaset_dance_athelaunch_NOtoNCWS.jpg 577w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/20181006_imaset_dance_athelaunch_NOtoNCWS-486x365.jpg 486w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Dancing to the Imaset as allies imprint with their hands their calls of No to NCWS Project.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now that song is the Imaset’s way also of capping a day or a program of gathering with increasing number of supporters. Be they part of the Kadumagetan or allies supporting the calls to save the soil, water and natural resources of Sierra Madre, they sing and dance it together in an ever-widening circle of prayerful activist. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<strong>By Clemente Bautista Jr. and Paul Christian Yang-ed</strong></p>
<p>Kalikasan has been conducting researches into the cases of killings of environmental defenders in Southeast Asia. From the data we gathered, so far, we observe the following three patterns or trends: </p>
<p><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/KPNE_chart1_killings-600x365.png" alt="Killings" width="600" height="365" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-104117" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/KPNE_chart1_killings-600x365.png 600w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/KPNE_chart1_killings.png 613w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>&#8211; There has been a total of at least 132 cases of killings in 7 countries in Southeast Asia since 2011 up to 2017; the Philippines accounts for 83 percent of the cases.</p>
<p>&#8211; There is a rising incidence of killings from 2011 to 2017, primarily reflecting the trend of cases from the Philippines. </p>
<p>&#8211; Most killings of environmental defenders are related to opposition to large-scale mining (88 deaths) and industrial plantation projects (26 deaths).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/KPNE_killings_perissue.png" alt="Killings" width="441" height="287" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-104118" /></p>
<p>We were unable to find any news report on the killings of environmental defenders in Vietnam, Laos, and East Timor. Thus, the figures are conservative since we were only able to document cases that have reached the English-speaking sphere. </p>
<p>It is surprising that Indonesia, an archipelagic country like the Philippines, just as rich in minerals, biodiversity, indigenous people, and forests, has a surprisingly fewer reported killings of environmental defenders, even lower than Thailand. </p>
<p>The number of recent killings of environmental defenders in Indonesia’s restive, resource-rich West Papua province has yet to be accounted for because of the travel restrictions imposed there by the Indonesian government.</p>
<p>Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam are ruled by military and authoritarian regimes, resulting in more difficult open reporting and investigation of killings of environment defenders than in the Philippines. </p>
<p>The language barrier is also a challenge. Unlike in the Philippines, most of the media and local organizations in countries in Southeast Asia do not post reports in English, hence, any report of killings of an environmental defender may go unnoticed by the international community.</p>
<p><strong>Humanizing the statistics</strong></p>
<p>Southeast Asia also has its own share of prominent cases of human rights violations among environmental defenders in the region that captured the attention of international media. Here are a few tidbits from their stories:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Sombath Somphone of Laos, a sustainable agriculture advocate.</strong> He was disappeared by suspected Laotian armed forces in 2012. He has yet to be found to this day.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Thwe Thwe Win, an activist opposed to the operations of the Letpadaung mine in Myanmar.</strong> In 2016, she was run over by a Chinese truck driver who works for the mining company. She survived the attack. In December 2014, 28 monks who joined a protest against the same mine project suffered burns from incendiary phosphorus hurled at them by the Burmese police.<br />
<figure id="attachment_104123" style="width: 728px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/KPNE_ThweThwe-840x560.png" alt="environmental defender" width="728" height="485" class="size-large wp-image-104123" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/KPNE_ThweThwe-840x560.png 840w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/KPNE_ThweThwe-548x365.png 548w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/KPNE_ThweThwe-768x512.png 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/KPNE_ThweThwe-272x182.png 272w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/KPNE_ThweThwe.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Thwe Thwe Win (Image credit: Lauren DeCicca/Front Line Defenders)</figcaption></figure><br />
3. <strong>Phan Sopheak, peasant member of an anti-illegal logging network in a community in Cambodia. </strong> Machete-wielding illegal loggers attacked her in March 2016. She survived the attack.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Le My Hanh, Vietnamese environmental activist.</strong> She was assaulted by thugs believed to have been hired by Vietnamese police in April 2017. Le was involved in the campaign to hold Taiwan-owned Formosa Ha Tinh Steel Corporation accountable for a toxic spill that occurred offshore in Vietnam in April 2016.<br />
<strong><br />
Philippines: Asia’s most dangerous for environmental defenders</strong></p>
<p>The Philippines remains as the most dangerous country for environmental defenders in Asia. Under the administration of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, human rights violations including attacks against environmental defenders have become more frequent. </p>
<p>Amid the rising authoritarianism of the Duterte regime, Kalikasan has monitored as of June 2018 at least 58 cases of killings of environmental defenders, 66 environmental defenders in illegal detention, and 240 environmental defenders slapped with trumped-up charges since the start of Duterte&#8217;s administration in July 2016. This, on top of the almost a million people displaced by the government’s militarization of resource-rich, rural areas. </p>

<p>Mining opponents comprise 55 percent of killed environmental defenders in the country. More mining opponents are being killed in the Philippines compared to the 30 percent of all environmental defenders worldwide who were killed as a result of their anti-mining advocacy. Impunity and injustice remain. Not a single mastermind of the killings has ever been convicted by the Philippine justice system.</p>
<p>On May 27, 2016, President Duterte declared martial law in Mindanao, home to more than 24 million Filipinos, Lumad (indigenous people), and the Muslim Moro people. The region hosts some of the country’s richest forests and mineralized areas. The government used the attack led by a small ISIS-inspired group in the Mindanao city of Marawi as a pretext to declare all Martial Law in Mindanao. </p>
<p>If government figures are to be believed, there were at least 1,132 deaths in the five-month war, a figure that was not verified independently by third-party organizations. Nevertheless, attacks against the people of Mindanao, even those outside of Marawi, have also intensified in the same period. More than 60 percent of the killings of environmental defenders under the Duterte regime happened in Mindanao.</p>
<p>On February 22, 2018, the Philippine Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a petition to the local courts listing more than 600 individuals as terrorists. Fifty-two (52) of these individuals are known activists and civil society representatives. </p>
<p>Included in the list is UN Special Rapporteur on Indigenous People Victoria Tauli Corpuz. Environmental advocates such as Sherwin de Vera, Zara Alvarez, Arnold Baes, and several others are also on the list. </p>
<figure id="attachment_104125" style="width: 480px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/KPNE_DATU_MANDAYHON.jpg" alt="environmental defender" width="480" height="321" class="size-full wp-image-104125" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/KPNE_DATU_MANDAYHON.jpg 480w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/KPNE_DATU_MANDAYHON-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Datu Mandayhon, an indigenous leader and environmental defender from Mindanao, is also included in the “terror” list.

<p>These individuals are accused of being a member of the revolutionary group Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its armed wing, the New People’s Army (NPA), which has been fighting the government for the last fifty years. </p>
<p>The government has had a bloody history of liquidating any person accused of being a member or sympathizer of the revolutionary group. The inclusion of environmental defenders in the ‘terror’ list poses security risks for them and their families.</p>
<p>On April 16, 2018, Australian missionary Sister Patricia Fox who is serving the poor in the Philippines for more than 27 years, was <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/04/16/immigration-agents-arrest-aussie-nun-active-human-rights-work-philippines/">illegally arrested by the Bureau of Immigration </a>for “attending protest rallies and engaging in political activities,” which is being forbidden by an archaic immigration law still in force. </p>
<p>Sr. Fox is a human rights defender and <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/04/25/aussie-nun-says-advocacy-consistent-mission/">development worker </a>who is active in opposing land-grabbing of private corporations and big landlords in the Philippines, as well as commiserating with Lumads displaced by extractives-associated militarization in their communities.</p>
<p>As the regime cracks down on activists and environmental defenders, on the other hand, it provides protection to companies and their environmentally-destructive projects. Military and economic interests are still strongly interlinked in the Philippines. </p>
<p>The government has the Investment Defense Force where regular military forces are deployed to secure investment projects in the country that are tagged as ‘priority’ or ‘vital to national interest’ such as large-scale mining operations, agricultural plantations, mega dam construction, and big eco-tourism projects. Government paramilitaries called Special Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Units (SCAA) can also serve as additional security forces of private corporations. </p>

<p>Based on the monitoring of Kalikasan, 69 percent, or an overwhelming majority of the suspected perpetrators in the killings of environmental defenders in the Philippines, were from the state military and paramilitary forces.  All of these &#8212; militarization, terrorist tagging, harassments, extra-judicial killings are believed to be sanctioned under the government counter-insurgency program Oplan Kapayapaan.<br />
<em><br />
Privatization of the commons, the commodification of natural resources, authoritarian regimes: a triple whammy for Asia’s environment and environmental defenders</em></p>
<p>The privatization of land, water, energy, and mineral deposits and the liberalization of state policies to attract investment in mining, energy, and agriculture institutionalize the commodification of the natural resources of poor countries in Asia. These globalization policies resulted in corporate ownership and control of these supposed public commons. </p>
<figure id="attachment_104127" style="width: 540px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/KPNE_Grasberg.png" alt="open-pit mine" width="540" height="334" class="size-full wp-image-104127" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Grasberg Mine open-pit as seen from space. (Image Credit: NASA)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead of using these resources to provide for the needs and help in developing the economy of poor Asian nations, private corporations control and exploit the land, water, minerals, and forests to produce cheap raw materials which would then be exported for the international market. </p>
<p>In this set-up, transnational corporations (TNCs) benefit the most from the billions of dollars of annual profit from exploiting the rich resources in the Asian region, at the expense of the environment and the people’s welfare. Chinese-owned Myanmar Wanbao Mining Ltd. which runs the controversial Letpadaung mine with a corporation owned by the Burmese military raked in $11.7 million in profits in 2015.</p>
<figure id="attachment_104182" style="width: 629px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/KPNE_extractive_giants.jpg" alt="mining giants" width="629" height="331" class="size-full wp-image-104182" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Freeport-McMoran’s reported negative net profits of $5.532 billion from 2011 to 2017.

[Summarized by Kalikasan PNE July 2018]</figcaption></figure>
<p>The national governments are some of the main proponents of policies in the region seeking easy entry of foreign capital and operation of TNCs into their countries, following the dictum of globalization. These economic and resource policies allow private corporations to seize tens of millions of hectares of land and offshore marine areas with impunity. </p>
<p>At the same time, pro-investor international mechanisms like the International Court for Investment Dispute (ICSID) of the World Bank, allows private corporations to sue national governments if they rescind project agreements or intervene in their business operations. </p>
<p>The proliferation of military regimes, authoritarian rulers, and inept and corrupt regimes in the region enable TNCs to freely destroy the environment for profit. These present a challenge for environmental defenders as these regimes tend to persecute and crush opposition to projects tied to corporate interests. </p>
<p>Under the pretext of supposed threats to national security, these regimes impose emergency rule or martial law in their country to suppress people’s opposition to environmentally-destructive projects and policies. They deny the people their basic human rights such as the freedom of speech and the right to organize. They militarize the civilian bureaucracy with retired military generals and officers and institutionalize surveillance mechanisms which impinge on the people’s right to privacy.</p>

<p><strong>Peoples’ Solidarity and Resistance across Southeast Asia</strong></p>
<p>However, amid these overwhelming challenges to environmental advocacy, various civil society and people’s organizations across the region still exert their effort to uphold the people’s right to a healthful ecology.</p>
<p>In the Philippines and in India the most vibrant and strongest people’s movements in the world can be found. There are inspirational campaigns which show how communities successfully thwarted plunderous projects of big corporations. </p>
<p>In the Indian states of Orissa and Tamil Nadu, communities forced global mining Vedanta to halt their destructive mining and dirty coal power plant, respectively. Another giant, Glencore was forced out of the Philippines because of the stiff resistance of indigenous peoples and peasants. In Southeast Asia, people’s movement against tyrannical government and military juntas are growing stronger each day. </p>
<p>International solidarity networks and regional coordination efforts are also strengthening and ongoing. Last November 2017, Kalikasan, International People’s Conference on Mining (IPCM), International People’s Movement for Self-Determination and Liberation (IPMSDL), Center for Environmental Concerns (CEC), and several regional organizations conducted a series of regional workshops and conferences to have a stronger unity and collective action on the issue of human rights violations among environmental defenders. </p>
<p>That same period, 49 organizations from 10 countries participated in the Workshop on Energy and Extractive Industries in the Southeast Asia Region under the ASEAN People’s Forum 2017 which was held in the Philippines. The workshop discussed the lessons of civil society organizations across various countries in Asia in confronting the issues of human rights and environmental protection against plunderous extractive and dirty energy projects.</p>
<p>These efforts were followed by a workshop in Bangkok last March 2018 at the Asia-Pacific People’s Forum on Sustainable Development.  This forum was attended by more than 60 organizations which committed to uniting to form a regional network and to formulate a regional campaign. </p>

<p>Last June 2018, the Southeast Asian Press Alliance (SEAPA) and Internews conducted a regional conference attended by environmentalists and media professionals. Next month, the Forest Defenders Conference being organized by civil society group Not1More will be held in Thailand.  </p>
<p>All of these are part and parcel of the Asian and Southeast Asian people’s movement in strengthening their international solidarity and their respective collective campaigns for the defense of the rights of environmental defenders, for the conservation of our natural resources, and for the defense of our environment. </p>

<p>At one point during his interrogation, he was made to strip naked and face his armed interrogators in a room chilled by air conditioning and an industrial fan.</p>
<p><strong>By MARYA SALAMAT</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA – Jerome Aladdin Succor Aba, 25, vice chairperson of Sandugo – Movement of Moro and Indigenous Peoples for Self-Determination – flew to the United States on April 17 for meetings with Filipino communities and human rights advocates. He would have stayed for these activities for a few weeks. But even as he holds a 10-year multiple entry US visa, the US Customs Border and Protection agents said <a href="http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2018/04/18/filipino-activist-detained-at-airport-for-removal-from-u-s/">he had “a technical glitch” </a>on his visa.</p>
<p>Based on Aba’s ordeal at the hands of immigration agents in the Philippines and the US, the so-called glitch in his visa was likely caused by the US-led “war on terror,” the blue print of the Philippine military’s counterinsurgency war, aerial bombings, and extra-judicial killings. The killings and harassments of people due to this war in the Philippines have been keeping human rights advocates and Moro leaders like Aba busy. But the Philippine government, having aligned itself with the US in  waging this war on terror, has been vilifying legal and progressive activists such as Aba as “terrorist.” The US war on terror is a borderless war aiming to maintain US hegemony. It prepositions US troops and equipment and uses the troops of “allies” such as the governments of its former colonies like the Philippines.</p>
<p>Aba believes his involvement in human rights work in the Philippines is the main reason he was deported. But not before he was detained, interrogated, threatened and tortured first in a US international airport.</p>
<p>“With the Trump administration thriving on misinformation and falsehoods, there is no place for me shedding light on the US’ hand in the destruction of Marawi and the ongoing ‘war on terror’against my Moro and Lumad brothers in Mindanao. This US ‘war on terror’ led to the killings of civilians, forced evacuation due to aerial bombings in communities, and has reinforced Islamophobia,” Aba wrote in his statement after arriving back in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Various groups are now urging the Philippine government to lodge protests with the US regarding the detention, harassment and torture, and violation of Aba’s other rights including his right to a legal counsel while being interrogated. What Aba suffered in the US may hint of similar restrictions in movement, association and speech of other freedom-loving Filipinos and citizens.</p>
<p>Even as Aba was being held against his will, questioned and threatened by armed US personnel, the US Embassy in Manila was announcing the start of activities for the 34<sup>th</sup> Balikatan war exercises.</p>
<p>The US government and military have been training Philippine armed forces and the police, sharing information and boosting what it calls as their interoperability.</p>
<p>Yearly, “US and PH military <a href="https://ph.usembassy.gov/balikatan-34/">demonstrate in Balikatan exercises</a> the cooperation and interoperability between the U.S. and Philippines, consistent with the Mutual Defense Treaty and Visiting Forces Agreement,” the US Embassy in Manila said on Aril 19.</p>
<p>“To improve their ability to coordinate a multilateral response to crisis, the two militaries will continue their commitment to train and share information,” the US Embassy also said.</p>
<p>What happened to Aba also followed the recent <a href="https://ph.usembassy.gov/us-homeland-security-investigations-trains-philippine-national-police-officers-united-states/">training provided by the US Homeland Security Investigations</a> to Philippine police officers.</p>
<p>The US Homeland Security Investigations and instructors of Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) “led rigorous sessions” on entry and defensive tactics, investigative techniques, interviews and interrogations, evidence collection, surveillance, and undercover operations. The participants in the training were officers of the newly-formed Philippine Transnational Criminal Investigative Unit (TCIU).</p>
<p>It is instructive that Jerome Aba was twice held up by the Philippine immigration personnel at the NAIA before he was allowed to board the plane on April 17.</p>

(Photo by M. Salamat / Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>A struggle against the US-led war on terror in Ph and US</strong></p>
<p>From the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila to the San Francisco International Airport in California, Aba was questioned about the purpose and activities of his US visit. “Will you be joining rallies there?” Aba was asked several times in Manila.</p>
<p>He arrived in San Francisco and before long, he faced US interrogators who already had compiled a thick stack of documents about him.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/04/25/muslim-human-rights-worker-mindanao-not-terrorist/">Aba’s recollection</a> of what transpired, the US Homeland Security and Customs Border and Protection agents treated him as a “terrorist,” forcing him to admit it in over 24 hours of interrogation under different agents in different rooms inside the San Francisco International Airport.</p>
<p>“Aba got a taste of some of the US military’s interrogation and torture technics reportedly being used in Guantanamo,” Cristina Palabay, secretary general of human rights group Karapatan, said at the first press conference where Aba shared what happened to him.</p>
<p>Aba recalled that he was taken out of the passengers’ line to the immigration and handcuffed. The US Homeland Security or Customs Border and Protection agents deprived him of his computer, cellphone, and luggage. They forced open his computer and cellphone and searched through his luggage. To his protestations and demands for a legal counsel, he was repeatedly told he has no rights. He was told the Universal declaration of rights did not cover him where he was. Five burly men would escort him when he needed to go to the men’s room.</p>
<p>It was approximately after around 24 hours into his detention and interrogation that Aba was first asked about what food he eats. Despite stressing he’s a Moro and he doesn’t eat pork, he was given a ham sandwich. “The tools of repression by the state can look so mundane,” he would write a few days later in his social media account.</p>
<p>At one point during his interrogation, he was made to strip naked and face his armed interrogators in a room chilled by air conditioning and an industrial fan.</p>
<p>Twice, he recalled being left alone in what looked like a deserted office, with a gun left lying around, at first, and the next time, a grenade and a cellphone. Aba purposely did not touch the weapons. “What did they hope to see me do? Kill myself? Start shooting at them?” he asked the media.</p>
<p>One of the interrogators called Lopez appeared to Aba as so riled up and paranoid that his hands would often reach for his gun if Aba moved a little while under questioning.</p>
<p>Aba noted that his behavior &#8212; ignoring the weapons left lying around, insisting he has rights &#8212; only seemed to infuriate the interrogators who kept accusing him, and forcing him to admit, that he is a “terrorist” or in league with “terrorists.”</p>
<p>As supposed proof, his interrogators presented Aba with a stack of papers about him. They showed his pictures with alleged “terrorists.” The US interrogators labeled the Moro Islamic Liberation Front peace panel chair Mohagher Iqbal and former Bayan Muna Rep. Satur Ocampo as “terrorists.” Aba replied that these two were not terrorists but are in fact working for peace.</p>
<p><strong>Silencing truth</strong></p>
<p>Various groups condemned the terrorist tagging and inhumane treatment of Aba.</p>
<p>&#8220;The US and PH governments want to terrorize dissent and keep the desecration of the country under wraps,” said Kabataan Partylist Rep. Sarah Elago. Bayan Muna filed a resolution in Congress seeking investigation and justice.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jerome-and-kerlan.jpg"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jerome-and-kerlan.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-102933" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jerome-and-kerlan.jpg 640w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jerome-and-kerlan-487x365.jpg 487w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Aba has a lot to say to his countrymen and friends of the Filipino people in the US about the Duterte government’s killings and the role of the US-instigated war on terror. He said the brazen attacks on the people and their rights are being executed to protect the interests of big US corporations.</p>
<p>Amid the Philippine government’s intensified militarization of Mindanao, it opened vast lands of Mindanao, including the territories of the Bangsamoro and ancestral domains of the indigenous people, to exploitation and plunder by companies such as Dole, Unifrutti, and Del Monte, Aba said.</p>
<p>Aba expressed gratitude for “the untiring protest actions” mounted by friends and organizations from all over the USA- from Portland to New York City.</p>
<p>“Your quick response to my situation, such as the rally at San Francisco Airport and call barrage, has helped tremendously in my release from the cruel clutches of the CBP and Homeland Security,” Aba said.</p>
<p>In the face of increased military responses to people’s resistance, Aba urged the public to help spread “the truth the US government wants to hide from the American people and the whole world.”</p>
<p>Amid Martial Law in Mindanao, Aba said a million hectares are being encroached on and operated by foreign mining businesses and 500,000 hectares by plantations. Also, a million hectares are reserved for the expansion of oil palm plantations by 2020. In Marawi where the US and the Philippines maintain military facilities, the current rehabilitation plan being discussed includes expanding the military reservation.</p>
<p>The US is also expanding its military bases in the Philippines. On April 17, the same day Aba was being detained in the US as an alleged “terrorist,” US Ambassador Sung Y. Kim and Defense Sec. Delfin N. Lorenzana were holding a groundbreaking ceremony for the first major project under the “Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA)” in Cesar Basa Air Base, Pampanga. Four others are in the pipeline. <a href="https://ph.usembassy.gov/enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement-groundbreaking-ceremony/">https://ph.usembassy.gov/enhanced-defense-cooperation-agreement-groundbreaking-ceremony/</a></p>
<p>“We will not sit on the sidelines and witness our people suffer from worsening environmental destruction, displacement, poverty, and grave human rights abuses,” Aba concluded in a public statement. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>“We may have diverged on the means but we have one goal, to bring about social justice so Filipinos can feel the benefits of democracy.”</p>
<p><strong>MARYA SALAMAT</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA – Embattled Supreme Court Chief Justice Ma. Lourdes Sereno radiated optimism when she joined hundreds of members of various groups in an Araw ng Kagitingan celebration in Quezon City on April 9. In a rare extended public speech of mixed formal English and Tagalog, she talked about the attacks on her as Chief Justice and the attacks on the Judiciary and revealed some of her plans for fighting back. She honored those who have been resisting tyranny even before her – the ordinary people and the victims of violence and attacks of Duterte’s policies. She expressed allegiance and unity with these groups and vowed commitment to the ongoing resistance.</p>
<p>For her, she said, this starts a new chapter in the struggle – a chapter where she’s with these broad groups of people she recognized as already in the fight. “Isang yugto na magkakasama na tayo at hindi magkakahiwalay.”</p>
<p>&#8220;If you think those in higher position in government are separated from you, not anymore. We will go down and be with you, &#8221; Sereno said in Filipino. She also expressed her enjoyment of being in a “unity for a good cause.”</p>
<p>“My situation is not unlike that of the ordinary oppressed people, I just have a dozen cameras on me,” she said in Filipino. She asked that her voice be also the voice of those who have been killed unjustly, whether in the urban poor communities or in the mountains and countryside.</p>
<p>Organized by the Movement Against Tyranny (MAT), Let’s Organize for Democracy and Integrity (LODI), and Coalition against Darkness and Dictatorship, the gathering conferred awards of “Pagkilala ng Kagitingan” to Sereno, to indigenous leader Joanna Cariño and to others active at resisting President Duterte’s “tyrannical rule.”</p>
<p>Although the Araw ng Kagitingan is mainly for honoring the sacrifices of those who died in the defense of the Republic, MAT “thought it appropriate to honor those still living and courageously fighting for democracy and human rights amid the state of tyranny and repression that grips our nation today.”</p>
<p>Also honored with Pagkilala sa Kagitingan were the Rise Up for Life and for the Rights group of families of victims of extra-judicial killings; and journalists who kept on their work despite threats and harassments from government authorities and Duterte supporters.</p>
<p><strong>‘Give your whole heart to achieve change’</strong></p>
<p>Sereno admitted her ordeal drew thoughts of just giving up. “If I will think of only my feelings, I will likely just give up,” Sereno told a broad gathering of anti-tyranny groups. Recalling though some initiatives to bring reforms into the judiciary, the dissenting opinions she had faced, and the other individuals and groups cited with a similar “Pagkilala ng Kagitingan,” she then talked of resolve.</p>
<figure id="attachment_102776" style="width: 656px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-102776" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Sereno_byMonRam_April9_QC_smm.jpg" alt="CJ Sereno" width="656" height="483" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Sereno_byMonRam_April9_QC_smm.jpg 656w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Sereno_byMonRam_April9_QC_smm-496x365.jpg 496w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Not without a fight. Finding herself in a similar plight with the poor and the oppressed, CJ Sereno draws the line, with the Constitution as guide, where the court judges and the president should be. (Photo by Mon Ramirez)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Referring to the struggle of the survivors of the drug war, of IP leader Joanna and of the journalists and photographers, she asked: “Ano dapat gawin para di sila nag-iisa?” (What must we do so that they would not be alone?) To face those hindering reforms, “What is important is giving it your whole heart.”</p>
<p>Sereno said changes have been underway in the judiciary but these have been “distracted.” Some of these changes include the technology-based fast-tracking of court functions through electronic courts and automated hearing.</p>
<p>Some of her initiatives, she said, had been ignored by the media. Among her actions as Chief Justice, Sereno disagreed with the majority of Supreme Court Justices in April 2013 when it ruled that the party-list system is not just for the marginalized. In November 2016, she was also one of the few justices who voted No to late Ferdinand Marcos&#8217; burial in the Libingan ng mga Bayani.</p>
<p><strong>Asking only for a fair process</strong></p>
<p>Nine months since, by Sereno’s reckoning, she has been forced into this “grueling ordeal”, she decried how her only demand for fair process has been denied. “It’s sad that “they can shred one’s dignity without giving us a chance to cross-examine.”</p>
<p>Until today, when she’s about to face another mode of unseating her, she hasn’t seen yet who is the complainant behind the impeachment case. There have been 15 to 17 hearings in Congress, but the House of Representatives has not yet submitted its report to the Senate. Instead, she said, Solicitor General Jose Calida filed an “unconstitutional” quo warranto petition before the Supreme Court to remove her as Chief Justice.</p>
<p>Calida called Sereno a “usurper,” but Sereno dismissed much of his claims and described it “the height of absurdity,” that the solicitor general was spending time poring over her record as a P6,000-earning assistant professor in UP decades ago.</p>
<p>She urged her fellow justices and the public to make the Solicitor General and the President explain his “unconstitutional” quo warranto petition.</p>
<p>In a separate venue, though, at about the same time, President Duterte reportedly responded not by calling for an investigation into the matter but by threatening more attacks to remove Chief Justice Sereno. He denied he was behind the moves to unseat Sereno as Chief Justice, but added that because of her talking back, he will &#8220;now&#8221; be her enemy.</p>
<p><strong>For a humble path, the Constitution and the people</strong></p>
<p>The ongoing attack of the executive on a co-equal branch, the judiciary, is among the trend of tyranny and dictatorial rule that galvanized the Araw ng Kagitingan unity of various groups. MAT asserts that the attempt to unseat Chief Justice Sereno is especially critical in lending a veneer of legality to Duterte&#8217;s plan to impose a dictatorship either through Charter change, martial law, or a rightist &#8220;revolutionary government.&#8221;</p>
<p>It has also been predicted to cause a Constitutional crisis. Based on Chief Justice Sereno&#8217;s much applauded response, the evolving crisis has made it clear that as far as she is concerned, the Supreme Court should take the path of humility, serve the people and be guided by the Constitution instead of the dictates of a few.</p>
<p>To the Movement Against Tyranny, LODI, Sandiwa alliance for indigenous peoples, Coalition against Darkness and Dictatorship, she said: “we may have diverged on the means but we have one goal, to bring about social justice so Filipinos can feel the benefits of democracy.”</p>
<p>In these perilous times,she urged the various groups gathered to maintain this unity and strengthen it.</p>
<p>“The judiciary belongs to the people,” Sereno said. Among others, she said it should be designed for the needs of the poor. It should feature judges whose master is the people and who can tell the president, &#8216;NO.&#8217; <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>From the Philippines to the rest of the world, the environment has always been regarded as ‘Mother Earth’, a life-giver and nurturer. Nature’s abundance is the bosom that sustains humanity.</p>
<p>The worldwide celebration of International Women’s month dawns upon us with Mother Earth besieged by the worst ecological crises she has ever faced — the likelihood of the next mass extinction event, the runaway climate disruption, and the exponential rate of pillaging the natural resources on a global scale.</p>
<p>But hope springs eternal. Environmental defenders everywhere are tirelessly working to protect the last frontiers of nature and restore our despoiled environment. </p>
<p>A number of exemplary individuals and organizations have been nominated in the upcoming Gawad Bayani ng Kalikasan Awards for their defense of Mother Earth. Let’s get to know four women nominees who are leading the way.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Bai-Bibyaon_l-365x365.jpg" alt="Bai Bibyaon" width="365" height="365" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-102410" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Bai-Bibyaon_l-365x365.jpg 365w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Bai-Bibyaon_l-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Bai-Bibyaon_l-90x90.jpg 90w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Bai-Bibyaon_l-64x64.jpg 64w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Bai-Bibyaon_l.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px" /><br />
<strong>BAI BIBYAON BIGKAY</strong></p>
<p>From the lush peaks of Pantaron Mountain Range in the Davao region, Abiok Ligkaian Bigkay, or “Bai Bibiaon”, is known as the only living woman chieftain of the Lumad people who has taken the helm in asserting the Lumad’s right to their ancestral domains and in preserving the rich biodiversity and natural resources of Pantaron.</p>
<p>Bai Bibiaon’s leadership is a keystone in the Lumad’s impregnable defense of Pantaron against big logging and mining, preserving its virgin forests and pristine headwaters in the process. She has also helped in instituting livelihood programs and alternative Lumad schools, greatly improving the self-sufficiency of their community. </p>
<p>These heroic exploits have been met with intensifying militarization in their communities, including attempted assassinations, forcing Bai Bibiaon and her tribe to flee their beloved homelands. The fierce woman-chieftain still remains a sentinel over the Pantaron through the generations of Lumad inspired to carry on with her struggle.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Beatrice-Belen_l-365x365.jpg" alt="Beatrice Belen" width="365" height="365" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-102411" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Beatrice-Belen_l-365x365.jpg 365w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Beatrice-Belen_l-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Beatrice-Belen_l-90x90.jpg 90w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Beatrice-Belen_l-64x64.jpg 64w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Beatrice-Belen_l.jpg 740w" sizes="(max-width: 365px) 100vw, 365px" /></p>
<p><strong>BEATRICE BELEN</strong></p>
<p>An indigenous Kalinga woman from the Uma tribe in the Cordillera region, Beatrice Belen is a fearless defender of her people’s ancestral lands. She is the Vice-Chairperson of Innabuyog, a regional women’s alliance safeguarding the lands and resources of the communities in Cordillera.</p>
<p>Beatrice, together with her fellow Kalingas, demonstrated remarkable leadership in forming a barricade in their village against the Chevron Energy Company’s proposed geothermal power project in 2012. They bravely faced down Chevron personnel installing the company’s implements without the people’s consent. </p>
<p>Beatrice’s uncompromising activism to defend the land, life, and resources of her people has never faltered despite the challenges and pressures. She believes that to fight for their ancestral rights is to honor the legacy and bravery of her forebears and to guard a promising future for the next generations to come.</p>

<p><strong>DR. EFLEDA BAUTISTA</strong></p>
<p>They are the ‘children of the storm,’ reborn from the rubble of Super Typhoon Yolanda’s aftermath. The People Surge, a movement of typhoon survivors built from Ground Zero of the world’s most powerful typhoon in history, transformed hapless victims of disaster neglect in the Eastern Visayas region into seekers of justice.</p>
<p>Bearing the banner of People Surge is its chairperson, the diminutive Dr. Efleda Bautista. A retired principal and local civic leader, Dr. Efleda survived Tacloban City’s massive storm surges but witnessed how many did not. </p>
<p>Realizing how their plight was not a deadly fortuitous event but a result of State abandonment and climate shocks, Efleda and thousands of others like her shook the nation with a series of protests crying “Justice for the Victims of Typhoon Yolanda!” from Eastern Visayas to the heart of Metro Manila. </p>
<p>People Surge has campaigned against blatant corruption in the government’s relief and reconstruction programs. They have successfully pressured the government to release long-withheld Emergency Shelter Assistance funds to their compatriots. More disasters have struck Eastern Visayas since then, and Dr. Efleda and the People Surge continue to be vigilant over the plight of survivors, old and new. </p>

<p><strong>JOSEFINA PANGINEN</strong></p>
<p>A half-blind day care teacher turned daring farmer-leader, Josefina Panginen—Ka Josie to her comrades in the peasant movement—serves as the Chairperson of the Panlalawigang Alyansa ng mga Magbubukid sa Aurora or PAMANA.</p>
<p>Through Ka Josie’s leadership, the frontline communities of Aurora have successfully stopped the destructive logging operations of Integrated Development Corporation, Pacific Timber Export Corporation, and other logging companies. Their campaigns against mining operations have also successfully resulted in the disapproval of 30 mining applications encroaching Aurora’s forests and agricultural lands. </p>
<p>Threats to land and life never seem to cease, as Ka Josie and her farmer compatriots are currently pitted against the Aurora Pacific Economic Zone and Freeport (APECO), and the PTC Energy Inc.’s Hydro Power Dam, among others. </p>
<p>But even with her old age and physical limitations, Ka Josie is steadfast in asserting that the land belongs to the tillers, not the plunderers. She is a shining example to many peasant women in continuing the fight to protect and defend our lands and environment.</p>
<p><em></p>
<p>The rest of the nominees and actual winners of the 2018 Gawad Bayani ng Kalikasan, an initiative of the Center for Environmental Concerns – Philippines, will be announced in the GBK Awards Ceremony on March 15, 3:00 to 5:00PM, at the Institute of Biology Auditorium of the College of Science, UP Diliman.</em></p>

Ibon Foundation and patriotic scientists are pushing for the development of the local steel industry, saying it is a basic industry that has a bearing on the development also of other industries, from construction to transportation to making machines for agriculture and consumer goods production. </p>
<p><strong>By MARYA SALAMAT</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></strong></p>
<p>MANILA – Rafael Hidalgo, vice-president for Corporate Development of <a href="http://www.steelasia.com/">Steel Asia Manufacturing Corporation</a>, easily demonstrates an intimate knowledge of the Philippine steel industry. In a forum on national industrialization held last week at the University of the Philippines in Quezon City, where he graduated as an engineer, he exceeded the time allotted him to give a succinct picture of the country’s steel industry. </p>
<p>His presentation simultaneously impressed and worried. On one hand, his company exhibits real and tested Filipino capability at modern steel production. On the other hand, its experience reveals the ever present threat of being hindered by what activist scientists call as “influence-peddlers,” mostly from big importers and policies on trade liberalization itself. </p>
<p>Undue competition from imports compounded by lack of government support has driven other Filipino-owned pioneering steel companies in the Philippines to close shop. Of those that remained, Steel Asia is the largest. Its five steel mills <a href="http://www.steelasia.com/products">contribute up to two million metric tons of semi-finished steel </a>in a year, directly giving jobs to three thousand workers and indirectly to at least 15 thousand more. It was the first to adopt modern technology in their time, when it began operation 50 years ago, Hidalgo said. </p>
<p>It is still ambitious today. It is building three more steel mills, one of which Hidalgo described as the world’s ‘largest and most modern steel bar rolling mill’ when finished. </p>
<p>With three new mills under construction, Steel Asia is set to more than double its two million metric ton annual production. But its expansion has been delayed for two and a half years now. </p>
<p>The “funding mafia is very strong,” Hidalgo lamented. He said this “mafia’s” lobbying has resulted in “sabotaging development of manufacturing projects with red tape.” </p>
<p>From what Hidalgo shared, the “influence-peddlers” serving those who stand to benefit big from importing other countries’ steel are behind the delays in their new steel mills. He said leaders of an influential business group are behind the importation and efforts to supplant local steel manufacturing with Chinese imports.</p>
<p>“Their plan is lucrative especially since it does not require long-term investment. But this<br />
comes at the expense of the country’s development, public safety, the labor force, and Philippine  industrialists and investors,” said Hidalgo.</p>
<p>Despite Steel Asia’s heft, it, too, appears to be at the mercy of what amounts to dumping of imported steel by other countries, which had developed its industries first, with strong support from their respective governments.  </p>
<p>At the forum, Hidalgo pinpointed some deadweight stunting the growth of Filipino steel. One of the heaviest is the “not level playing field,” which makes it easier to import steel than manufacture it.  Another example is how locally produced steel are being rigorously tested, yet testing is relaxed for imported steel. Hidalgo said this <a href="http://www.steelasia.com/news-room/philippine-iron-steel-institute">allows substandard steel</a> into the market. </p>
<p><strong>Resisting the trend of ‘arrested development’ </strong></p>
<p>Construction takes up much of the current demand for Philippine steel. But if change is indeed coming, for instance through policies for national industrialization, the forum organizers forecast higher rates of increase in local demand for steel. Which is as should be, they said, considering the country has a wealth of human and natural resources.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately for Steel Asia and for what remained of the ‘industries’ of the Philippines, past and present economic policies have constricted and stunted rather than grow and boost local industries. No thanks to neoliberal policies of privatization and liberalization, the country’s manufacturing is now at its lowest (or smallest), according to Sonny Africa, executive director of <a href="http://ibon.org/2016/09/ibon-joins-groups-in-industrialization-call/">Ibon Foundation</a>, during the forum on national industrialization. </p>
<p>Both Sonny Africa of Ibon, and <a href="http://agham.org/press-releases/scientists-unite-other-sectors-call-national-industrialization">Ganni Tapang, president of Agham</a> (Advocates for Science and Technology for the People), said that it makes much more sense now and in the long run to tap these human and natural resources for Philippine industrialization and development rather than export it raw and cheap.</p>
<p>Ibon Foundation and patriotic scientists are pushing for the development of the local steel industry, saying it is a basic industry that has a bearing on the development also of other industries, from construction to transportation to making machines for agriculture and consumer goods production. </p>
<p>President <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FKBbzU5agg">Duterte has also said as much</a>, calling the steel industry “the mother of industries”. </p>
<p>Developing this industry, they said, could better provide Filipinos with jobs and keep more of the income and capital at home. It is thus the complete opposite of export orientation and import dependence, the decades-long thrusts taken by succeeding governments, which resulted to today’s worst joblessness and poverty, according to Ibon.</p>
<p>They rejected the notion that it is better to import steel just because it seems cheaper. </p>
<p>“A genuinely Filipino iron and steel industry is a vital strategic element for Philippine socioeconomic development, stability and national security. It can still serve as the backbone of manufacturing and national industrialization even amid the hyped globalization of the 21st century,” Ibon said in its paper last July.</p>
<p><strong>#BuildFilipino: Challenge to develop the steel industry</strong></p>
<p>Although the steel industry is a basic industry that requires growing and developing if change is to come, it has no continuous production chain in the Philippines. “Almost all existing or potential manufacturing industries are unsupported or not linked to the domestic steel industry,” Hidalgo said.</p>
<p>Viewing the industry from upstream (basic processing of iron ore in steel mills) to midstream (hot rolling slabs or billets to manufacture steel bars, sections, wire rods, rolled coil and plates, etc.) and downstream (manufacturing products using steel for parts, from scissors to body of vehicles, ships, infrastructure), it shows what “mostly we don’t have,” said Hidalgo.<br />
<figure id="attachment_93685" style="width: 728px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/steel_industry_value_addition_1.jpg"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/steel_industry_value_addition_1-1024x673.jpg" alt="Steel industry" width="728" height="478" class="size-large wp-image-93685" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">From Steel Asia: &#8216;We have no integrated steelmaking, no hot rolling, no section, no plates&#8230;. &#8221;</figcaption></figure><br />
So, “Up and down the value chain, there are broken links and reliance on imports,” said Hidalgo. As a result, he continued, “Our resources are exported and brought back to us as finished goods, and all the jobs and value added are going to the countries that exported (steel) to us.” The steel company where Hidalgo works is mainly producing steel rebars for construction. </p>
<p>In a paper issued last July, entitled <a href="http://ibon.org/2016/07/filipino-steel-and-national-development/">“Filipino Steel and National Development</a>,” Ibon Foundation said the country&#8217;s steel consumption has more than doubled from 3.5 million tons in 2004 to some 7.6 million tons in 2013. Most of the steel consumed were imported, reaching 4.1 million tons in 2014, or more than double the 2.0 million tons imported in 2010. Iron and steel imports were the country&#8217;s sixth biggest imported products amounting to US$1.7 billion in 2015 (after electronics, oil, machines and engines, vehicles, and plastics). These mainly come from China and Russia, also from Korea, Japan, and Taiwan.   </p>
<p>Last year, Hidalgo said, the country consumed 8.56 million metric tons of steel. To produce this much steel, the country needs a lot more steel factories, a lot more employed workers adding value in every stage of production. “Importing a big portion of 8.56 million metric tons means giving away job opportunities and paying dearly for all those value added to other countries instead of to Filipino industries,” Hidalgo said. </p>
<p>A primer distributed at last week’s forum on national industrialization also said the Philippine steel industry is competitive with any in the world, and investments in state-of-the-art technology are guaranteed returns, provided there is a level playing field. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>“With the national elections, it is crucial to convey to candidates the role of science and technology in national development and progress.” </p>
<p><strong>By MARYA SALAMAT</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></strong></p>
<p>MANILA – How can you benefit from the upcoming elections? How can change for the better really start to happen with the coming elections?</p>
<p>Every election campaign, Filipinos are bombarded with the most glowing promises, the highest sounding brags about which Filipino dreams will come true once a certain group of politicians are voted in power. </p>
<p>But to Filipino scientists, youths, users and purveyors of technology, there is one thing national and local candidates can and must vow to do, that may indeed help the economy grow and lead more Filipinos toward development. They said the government can and must cooperate in developing science and technology – with the people as the priority. For that to happen, it said, the current crop of candidates have to be truly after the development of basic national industries as the cornerstone of any genuine development in science and technology.</p>
<p>In attendance at a press forum last week by AGHAM (Advocates of Science and Technology for the People) were experts, science and technology workers, researchers, students, and science advocates who came together to point out many specific examples of highly flawed government actions that undermined science and technology and its huge potentials for uplifting the Philippine economy. They are seeking to change that.</p>
<p>They pressed candidates to include science and technology in their platform –not in lip service generality, but in concrete ways that Filipinos will feel on the ground.  </p>
<p>Feny Cosico, Secretary General of AGHAM, said that “With the national elections, it is crucial to convey to candidates the role of science and technology in national development and progress.” </p>
<p>With her were experts of various ages and experiences, whose life work showed how government could have improved science and technology and helped its citizens, but instead did the opposite or did nothing.</p>
<p>Their program, called ‘Science and Technology Agenda 2016: Developing a Genuine S&#038;T for the People’, hopes to gather the sentiments of people in the science and technology sector and consolidate their calls and aspirations into a unified platform. </p>
<p><em>Read also:</em> <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2016/03/03/we-dont-have-to-…ogy-govt-support/">‘We don’t have to import rice with improved technology, govt support’ </a><br />
<a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2016/03/03/dont-force-scien…a-vow-of-poverty/">‘Don’t force scientists into a vow of poverty’ </a><br />
<a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2016/03/03/we-have-excellen…ur-acts-together/">‘We have excellent resources, people but government not helping to put our acts together’</a><br />

<a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2016/03/03/people-should-ha…m-for-the-people/">‘People should have access to publicly funded data, utilities’ </a></p>
<p>From AGHAM’s experiences in pushing the government to prioritize the people in its mining policies, projects in power and transport industries, reforestation and working at disaster response and rehabilitation, AGHAM’s Cosico has come to a conclusion that “Our capacity to make use of science and technology to improve the quality of life of Filipinos has been hampered by lack of government support and a sustainable program to make technological development accessible and beneficial for the masses.” </p>
<p>To advance science and technology that serves the interests of the people, Filipino scientists should receive proper education and training, said JM Ayuste, spokesperson of Agham Youth-PUP. But, citing his school as example, he said it is highly doubtful we can achieve that with only one laboratory per 1,325 students in their public elementary and high schools. </p>
<p>He said it is not encouraging for students to pursue science when  “in state universities like the PUP, students are forced to conduct their science experiments in hallways in the absence of working laboratories.”</p>
<p>AGHAM is seeking to elevate the country’s science and technology problems into important electoral agenda that the people can use to gauge the vote-worthiness of candidates. For Ayuste of Agham-Youth, pursuing that should start with the government supporting science education.</p>
<p>In summary, some of AGHAM’s calls and demands for candidates to take up include: Increased support for research and development; Strengthening science and technology (S &#038; T) education and raining; upholding S &#038; T workers’ rights; Upholding agricultural modernization and advancing national industrialization.  </p>
<p>In the coming elections, Cosico said scientists, researchers, engineers, science workers, students, technologists and advocates will be keeping a watchful eye on candidates’ platforms and programs. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>“Teachers have the greatest responsibility, but the enormous salary lag compared to top government officials is despicable.”</p>
<p><strong>By ANNE MARXZE D. UMIL</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em>  </p>
<p>MANILA – The Salary Standardization Law 2015 (SSL) was passed on third and final reading at the House of Representatives on Wednesday, Dec. 9, amid protests that it is skewed in favor of top-ranking officials. </p>
<p>House Bill 6268 was passed by 170 votes, with only five voting against. ACT Teachers Partylist Rep. Antonio Tinio stood by his position that the increase given to lower and middle employees is minuscule compared to the increase given to higher positions in the government. </p>
<p>“We voted no because the whole process that the SSL 2015 went through is undemocratic. The government employees’ were not even consulted. How did the DBM (Department of Budget and Management) and Malacañang come up with this proposal? Only by consulting the American human resources consulting firm, Towers Watson. We are stressing, that there is no consultation made with the employees here,” Tinio said.</p>
<p>Based on the SSL 2015, the current salary of those who are in the front line of service, such as teachers and nurses, will increase from P18,549 ($393) a month to P20,745 ($440) or 11.89 percent increase. According to Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT), this is only P2,205 ($47), and when divided into four tranches would be $551 ($12) each year.  </p>
<p>Rank-and-file police, soldiers and other uniformed personnel will also be granted an increase of 12 percent, from P14,834 ($315) to 16,597 ($352). </p>
<p>Meanwhile, senators, congressmen and cabinet secretaries will have an increase of 186 percent, or from P90,000 ($1,908) a month to P257,809 ($5,465). The salaries of the Vice President and House Speaker will increase from P103,000 ($2,183) to 307,365 ($6,516) and the President from P120,000 ($2,544) to P388,096 ($8,228).</p>
<p>Louie Zabala, Manila Public School Teachers’ Association president said the gap on the salary increase between rank-and-file and top officials is scandalous. “Indeed, there is money for SSL 2015, but the poorly-paid teachers and other rank-and-file employees’ demands were ignored by Malacañang,” Zabala said.  </p>
<p><strong>‘Not enough for majority of government employees’</strong></p>
<p>In his privilege speech, Tinio said the SSL 2015 is not enough for the clerk, utility worker, public school teacher, public nurse, soldiers, police, firefighters and others who make up the two-thirds of the 1.4 million bureaucracy of the government. </p>
<p>He said that while bonuses will be also given to the government employees, it is the salary that will address the employee’s everyday expenses. </p>
<p>“There is midyear bonus or sometimes called 14th month pay and Enhanced Performance Based Bonus. But what I assert is salary increase for the government employees and not bonuses that have conditions. Because this is how it goes with the Performance Based Bonus,” the teachers&#8217; representative said. </p>

<p>Tinio said it will also serve as an investment in the future when an employee retires. “Their retirement will be based on their salary and not in their bonuses,” he said. </p>
<p><strong>Senate interpellation</strong></p>
<p>Public school teachers, meanwhile, urged senators to consider amending the SSL 2015. </p>
<p>ACT President Benjamin Valbuena said senators only have the same response on their lobby campaign in the Senate this week. “We were told that the SSL 2015 will be passed as it is, because it is what DBM Secretary Florencio Abad and President Aquino want,” said Valbuena in their protest in front of the Senate on Thursday, Dec. 9.</p>
<p>They also held their nationwide sit-down strike on the same day. In Calderon Integrated High School and Lagro High School, no classes were held. </p>
<figure id="attachment_87721" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/teacher-ssl-03.jpg"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/teacher-ssl-03.jpg" alt="Public school teachers trooped to the Senate to call on Senators to amend the Salary Standardization Law 2015.

<p>Public schools teachers lamented that government officials were voted by the people, and should listen to the call of the majority instead of Abad and Aquino. </p>
<p>“We know that the legislative, judiciary and executive are separate. But Aquino is not following the process. It appears here that Aquino and Abad exercise power over the legislative and the judiciary,” said Valbuena. </p>
<p>The public school teachers lament that so much have changed through the years, but their salary has failed to keep up. Their workloads increased, their bonuses are now based on their performance, they are forced to innovate their teaching methods without proper funding from the government, and forced to do clerical work, such as encoding students&#8217; names in the Department of Education website. </p>
<p>Teacher Ana (real name withheld due to request), who has been teaching in public school in Caloocan for 10 years, lamented that teachers are being undermined with the Results-Based Performance Management System. </p>
<p>“We are now being rated based on our output, when it is not a regulation back then. We are told to produce researches as a ‘give back’ to the bonuses that we received. It’s as if we are not doing our duty to Filipino children,” she told <em>Bulatlat.com</em>. She too agreed that the SSL 2015 is not enough and should be amended.</p>
<p>Rommel Candido, a teacher in Navotas, hit the implementation of the K to 12 curriculum without the DepEd providing books, equipment and facilities. “Our school offer cookery but there is not a single stove in our school,” said Candido. </p>
<p>“Teachers have the greatest responsibility, but the enormous salary lag compared to top government officials is despicable. Aquino’s SSL 2015 will widen the gap. The SSL 2015 creates a perverse bias against education and undermining the possibility of improving its poor quality,” said Valbuena. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a>    </p>

<p><strong>By ANNE MARXZE D. UMIL </strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em> </p>
<p>MANILA – As the government’s new curriculum nears its full-blown implementation next school year, the last quarter of 2015 saw parents of Grade 10 students scrambling to find low-cost private schools which offer senior high school (SHS) – the additional two years of secondary education under K to 12. </p>
<p>Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/05/08/k-to-12-deped-says-800k-to-1-m-grade-11-students-to-be-displaced-in-2016/" target="_blank">Department of Education (DepEd) announced </a>that only 5,800 out of the 7,748 public high schools in the Philippines are set to offer Grades 11 and 12. </p>
<p>Education Secretary Armin Luistro, FSC said that up to 2.2 million students can be accommodated in public schools, but some 800,000 to one million students are expected to go to private high schools and colleges, state universities and colleges that will offer senior high school. </p>
<p>Now here come the Affordable Private Education Centers, also known as APEC schools, which promise low-cost, “world-class quality education,” which  appeal to lower- to middle-income families who cannot afford college-level fees for the added two years of high school. </p>
<p>However, many K to 12 critics say that, with the rise of schools such as Apec, the new curriculum would not only be geared toward producing cheap labor for big business, but also paves the way for big business to get even more profits: through education.</p>
<p><strong>Education is good business</strong></p>
<p>In May 2014, the <a href="http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/361116/money/companies/ayala-corp-is-now-in-the-business-of-education-high-school-at-p64-a-day" target="_blank">Ayala Corporation announced its new business venture</a> &#8212; low-cost private high school.</p>
<p>The Apec schools are a chain of for-profit secondary schools, created by <a href="https://www.pearson.com/" target="_blank">British company Pearson PLC,</a> the biggest education corporation in the world, through its venture capital fund the Pearson Affordable Learning Fund (PALF), and Ayala Corporation, through its edu-business arm, LiveIt Global Services Management Institute (LGSMI).</p>
<p>A recently released research commissioned by Education International, however, revealed that behind the promise of low-cost but world-class education is a profit-driven design aimed to supply cheap labor to global industrial capitalists. </p>
<p>The research entitled “<a href="http://download.ei-ie.org/Docs/WebDepot/Philippine%20Study/Research_C.%20Riep_APEC%20Philippines_final.pdf" target="_blank">Corporatised Education in the Philippines: Pearson, Ayala Corporation and the emergence of Affordable Private Education Centers (Apec)</a>,” was written by Canadian Curtis B. Riep, a doctorate student in the Department of Educational Policy Studies at the University of Alberta.</p>
<figure id="attachment_87581" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ei-research-launch.jpg"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ei-research-launch.jpg" alt="Curtis Riep (left), the author of the research &quot;“Corporatised Education in the Philippines: Pearson, Ayala Corporation and the emergence of Affordable Private Education Centers (Apec) and Angelo Gavrielatos (right), Education International&#039;s program coordinator express concern over the interference of private sector in the Philippine public education system.

<p>The independent research commissioned by Education International said K to 12 created an opportunity for private corporations to take part in the Philippine education system. In this case, the Ayala and Pearson conglomerates have built Apec schools targeting lowest-income learners. </p>
<p>Education International (EI) is an organization of educators in 170 countries around the globe.    </p>
<p><strong>Promoting privatization</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/05/16/1323665/ayala-pearson-open-affordable-world-class-high-schools" target="_blank">Apec schools are packaged as world-class private high schools at an affordable cost</a>, for as low as P64 a day which includes books, computers and fees.</p>
<p>But Riep said Apec school fees still cost at least P24,850 ($527) a year, or 40 percent of the income of a poor family. </p>
<p>Riep said there are currently 12 APEC schools in the National Capital Region with approximately 1,500 students. He said APEC plans to expand in the next years to come.</p>
<p>In 2016, it plans to double its chain to 24 schools serving 4,000 students. He said that in 10 years time, APEC plans to grow and expand their chain of schools to 500 schools serving 250,000 students in the whole Philippines. </p>
<p>“An APEC student paying at least 25,000 per year for classroom services and with this rate, 250,000 youth paying P25,000 is a very, very lucrative business venture for Ayala and Pearson,” said Riep.  </p>
<p><strong>DepEd lifts own regulations</strong></p>
<p>But how did Apec schools cut down its expenses? Riep’s research said DepEd has relaxed a number of regulations “so that Apec and its shareholders can implement their low-cost, for-profit schooling experiment with limited government restriction.” </p>
<p>For one, DepEd has given permission for Apec schools to operate in unused or vacant commercial buildings which Apec could lease, instead of purchasing land and constructing proper school facilities. </p>
<p>James Centenera, former business development manager of Pearson Affordable Learning Fund who was interviewed by Riep for the research, said that they talked to the government to have some regulations relaxed.   </p>
<p>The DepEd’s Manual of Regulations for Private Schools in Basic Education states: “Unless exempted by the Secretary, each private school shall own its site, or shall have a definite and feasible program for ultimate ownership thereof within a reasonable period, which should be adequate and suitable for the buildings and activities of the school.” </p>
<p>In the research, a property space rented by Apec is typically on the upper levels of vacated commercial buildings that include three to four office rooms, transformed into secondary classrooms that house approximately 30 to 45 students each.   </p>
<p>The research also said that because the school facilities have been downsized, Apec schools have no science laboratories, gymnasiums, or libraries, which DepEd requires of all private secondary schools. </p>
<p>“Apec is forced to be creative in their usage of operational space for classes such as physical education (PE) or laboratory-oriented courses. One Apec teacher explained, ‘PE is difficult in our space because it’s so small the children can’t really move around. But we try to maximize the space to try and get the children to move around a bit,” said the study.  </p>
<p>Like the condition in public schools, Riep said there were complaints on poor air ventilation and overcrowded classrooms. If school management puts on air conditioning, they will also pass the cost to clients &#8212; in this case, the students. </p>
<p>“Because at the end of the day we are not a charitable institution, we are still a business. So is it going to be profitable for the company?” the research said, quoting an Apec school head.  </p>
<p><strong>Low qualification, low compensation for teachers</strong></p>
<p>The research also revealed that approximately 70 percent of teachers in all Apec schools do not have proper professional accreditation, which is the Licensure Examination for Teachers, required by DepEd for secondary school teachers. Riep said these teachers are also paid severely low wages. </p>
<figure id="attachment_87580" style="width: 543px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/apec-schools-courtesy-of-ei-research-02.jpg"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/apec-schools-courtesy-of-ei-research-02.jpg" alt="Photo grabbed from Riep Curtis&#039; research: “Corporatised Education in the Philippines: Pearson, Ayala Corporation and the emergence of Affordable Private Education Centers (Apec)  " width="543" height="390" class="size-full wp-image-87580" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/apec-schools-courtesy-of-ei-research-02.jpg 543w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/apec-schools-courtesy-of-ei-research-02-508x365.jpg 508w" sizes="(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Photo grabbed from Riep Curtis&#8217; research: “Corporatised Education in the Philippines: Pearson, Ayala Corporation and the emergence of Affordable Private Education Centers (Apec)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Riep said Apec teachers, referred to as “learning facilitators,” receive lesson guides that tell them what to cover and provides them with activities to facilitate a class.   </p>
<p>“We ask teachers not to deviate from the lesson guide because it can provide inconsistency across the chain and we don’t know if all teachers are equipped to do it otherwise,” an Apec administrator was quoted as saying in the research. </p>
<p>The DepEd, the research said, also permitted Apec to lower the standard for a qualified teacher. </p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/361116/money/companies/ayala-corp-is-now-in-the-business-of-education-high-school-at-p64-a-day" target="_blank">news report</a>, Apec Human Resources director Pam Wu said that they give low compensation to teachers to ensure that they “are able to balance cost and revenue.”  </p>
<p>Riep quoted one Apec school manager as saying,: ‘Sometimes quality is compromised because of the companies’ concern for making profit.’”  </p>
<p>With this, Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) secretary general, France Castro said the Apec and the DepEd is violating the teachers’ rights. “This only proves that these private schools are not really operating for service but for profit. What’s worse is that the DepEd is in connivance with these corporations &#8212; the Ayala and Pearson.”  </p>
<p>“It only goes to show how subservient our government is to the dictates of corporations,” she added. </p>
<p><strong>Cheap labor for companies</strong></p>
<p>Riep’s research showed that Apec schools were designed to produce cheap and flexible labor not only to the local but also global labor market. </p>
<p>“By focusing on skills and traits required by industry and reverse-engineering a curriculum to inculcate the necessary dispositions, Apec’s corporatized system of education has oriented learner outcomes to serve the interests of industrial capitalists,” the research read.</p>
<p>The research quoted Apec president Alfredo Ayala’s explanation: “We literally brought Ayala companies to the campus and asked Bank of the Philippine Islands or Globe Telecom to tell us what they need to hire by March, what are the specs, observe the high performers and let’s reverse engineer the curriculum.”</p>
<p>In turn, Riep said, “Apec students learn skills that include processing bank loans and selling android phones.”</p>
<p>Riep said Apec follows the DepEd’s K to 12 curriculum by offering mathematics, science, English, Filipino, social studies, MAPEH (music, arts, physical education and health) and TLE (technology and livelihood education). However, Apec’s curricula focuses on employability skills and traits, at the expense of foundational subject learning. </p>
<p>Apec curriculum also focuses on English communication skills required for employment in call centers.</p>
<p>In turn, Riep said, Apec schools involve two forms of privatization: de facto privatization in the form of user fees paid for by students in exchange for basic education, and privatization that exists because of the increasing private control and influence in the social relations of production.. </p>
<p>He said this is demonstrated by the joint venture between Ayala and Pearson that aims to produce a repository of labor with the skills, knowledge and values in demand by industry.</p>
<p>Angelo Gavrielatos, project coordinator of Education International, lamented that instead of pushing for free education, government even promotes Apec schools, which are not that cheap. </p>
<figure id="attachment_87578" style="width: 535px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ei-research-launch-02.jpg"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ei-research-launch-02.jpg" alt="Education International (EI) is an organization of educators in 170 countries around the globe, calls on all government to prioritize students before profit.

<p>&#8220;Rather than investing in quality free primary and secondary education for all, the Philippine government is encouraging the growth of for-profit Apec private schools. Fees charged by Apec represent about 40 percent of the income of the poor in the Philippines. That’s hardly affordable,&#8221; Gavrielatos said at the launch of the research in November. </p>
<p><strong>A nation of low-wage, contractual workers</strong></p>
<p>Apec schools, in line with DepEd’s K to 12, promise employability, but critics of the K to 12 argued that it will not solve the joblessness that has plagued the country for decades. </p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/04/24/not-k12-but-natl-industrialization-to-solve-joblessness-kmu/" target="_blank"><em>Bulatlat.com report</em></a>, labor group Kilusang Mayo Uno said K to 12 will further make the country a “nation of low-wage workers persistently locked in contractual employment.”</p>
<p>Through K to 12, the labor group said the production of cheap labor will be even more systematic.<br />
The KMU said the government has been promoting lies about “jobs mismatch” as an excuse for the widespread unemployment in the country and for re-tooling the country’s education system to further suit the interests of big foreign and local capitalists.</p>
<p>The group said many Filipinos are jobless because only a few jobs are available in the country, not because Filipinos are not skilled enough for the available jobs. “It is foolish to think that the country’s problem in employment can be solved by adjustments in the education system,” group said.</p>
<p><strong>‘Invest in education’</strong></p>
<p>Gavrielatos said the government has an obligation to properly fund education. </p>
<p>“What we’re worried about is that the announcement of K to 12 without the necessary funding is providing an opportunity, and in fact, the government is encouraging the entry of corporate, for profit, non-state actors to come to education. For-profit actors are driven by the profit making. That is the primary objective &#8212; to increase profit,” Gavrielatos said in a separate interview with <em>Bulatlat.com</em>. </p>
<p>He added that the profit motive has no place in dictating what is taught in schools, how it’s taught or how schools are organized because in that world the first casualty are students and quality of education.</p>
<p>“To generate  profits, Apec and other similar chains, employ fewer  and unqualified teachers and provide facilities which do not comply to standards. What’s quite regrettable in this regard, and almost scandalous, is that the government has waived regulations that exist in the provision of education, to satisfy the business interests of Pearson and Ayala,” Gavrielatos said.</p>
<p>“Whenever you put a price on education, it’s a barrier when it comes to access in education. We call on all governments to fulfill its obligation to provide the political and financial commitment necessary to realize free primary and secondary education for all,” Gavrielatos added. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a> </p>

<p>“We bring home victory: the support of a broad range of people to the people’s resistance in Mindanao, which is also the Filipino people’s struggle.”</p>
<p><strong>By DEE AYROSO</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA – The Manilakbayan ng Mindanao, heads back down south of the archipelago today, Nov. 22.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/10/23/manilakbayan-ng-mindanao-bringing-the-peoples-struggle-to-the-center/" target="_blank">The 700-strong protest caravan</a> has wrapped up their journey this year, in which they travelled 1,000 kilometers through the Visayas, Bicol, and Southern Tagalog, all the way to Metro Manila. They had marched hundreds of kilometers, staged dozens of protests, and had some skirmishes with police.</p>
<p>President Aquino continued to ignore the Manilakbayan, but that matters little now, as they have received the attention and overwhelming support, from schools, students, athletes, netizens, the Catholic Church and other church denominations, NGOs, <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/11/09/sunday-at-the-kampuhan-aldub-fans-artists-and-doctors-visit-the-lumad/" target="_blank">showbiz personalities, Aldub fans,</a> and even <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/10/24/caloocan-and-marikina-city-councils-echo-calls-to-stoplumadkillings/" target="_blank">local government councils.</a> And these are enough to declare that the journey was worth taking.</p>
<p>“We bring home victory: the support of a broad range of people to the people’s resistance in Mindanao, which is also the Filipino people’s struggle,” said Kerlan Fanagel, chairperson of Pasaka day Salugpungan Kalimudan (Pasaka – Regional Federation of Lumád in Southern Mindanao Region) and third nominee of the Sulong Katribu partylist.</p>
<p>Their calls &#8212; “Stop Lumád killings, Save our schools, Pull out military from the communities, Disband paramilitary groups” – had reverberated and were echoed in many unexpected quarters in the National Capital Region, and abroad.</p>
<p>“Malacañang did not respond, but we can see that they are affected, by the broad and huge support that Manilakbayan received,” Fanagel said.</p>
<p>“If they were not affected, they would not put up the ‘overkill’ police blockade here at Baclaran,” Fanagel said, referring to the 1,300 police men and trainees who had <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/11/14/police-barricade-manilakbayan-inside-baclaran-church-grounds/" target="_blank">guarded the Lumád camp for days</a> before, during and after the Asia-Pacific Economic Conference (Apec) summit.</p>

<p>The Lumád presence in Manila was indeed, hard to ignore. They set up a Kampuhang Bayan (people’s camp) at the University of the Philippines in Diliman Quezon City, then at the Liwasang Bonifacio in Manila, and lastly at the Baclaran Church grounds in Parañaque City. Each camp became a political and cultural center where tens of thousands of youths, activists, concerned citizens and just the generally curious, gravitated.</p>
<p>They tirelessly staged protests, almost on a daily basis, on several occasions, even three times in a day. Corporate media had to take notice, which prompted Presidential Spokesperson Herminio Coloma to issue a statement that government is doing what it can to address the issue of Lumád killings.</p>
<p>But this year’s Manilakbayan victories were preceded by <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/09/01/deadly-rampage-lumad-school-head-2-manobo-leaders-killed-in-surigao-sur/" target="_blank">the Sept. 1 killing of the Lianga martyrs,</a> tribal school executive director Emerito Samarca, Manobo leaders Dionel Campos and Datu Juvello Sinzo. The ensuing outrage set off the Mindanao protest caravan on a heightened fervour with a call for justice.</p>
<p>After a whole month of campaign, the arrest warrant for the perpetrators – Magahat-Bagani paramilitary men – remain unserved, in spite of reports that they are seen in the company of soldiers in Surigao del Sur.</p>
<p>Worse, at least two Lumád were killed in paramilitary attacks in Bukidnon and Davao del Norte, one <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/10/23/bukidnon-village-chief-shuts-down-fr-pops-school/" target="_blank">tribal school was shut down</a> by a village official, and <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/11/12/suspected-soldiers-burn-down-alcadev-cottage-in-agusan-del-sur/" target="_blank">another razed to the ground</a> by suspected soldiers in Agusan del Sur.</p>
<p>Thousands remain in evacuation centers, as soldiers and paramilitary men remain in the communities, as do the threats of trumped-up charges against Lumád leaders and other activists.</p>
<p>One of them, Datu Juanito Binaton <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/10/30/terror-in-white-culaman/" target="_blank">of White Culaman village, Kitaotao, Bukidnon,</a> learned while at the Manilakbayan, that 64 residents of his village were slapped with criminal charges, including him and his daughter, Marissa Ejanel, and a number of the Manilakbayan delegates.</p>
<p>If the soldiers are still in their community, Binaton said, he fears that they will be arrested or abducted.</p>
<p>Such threats, at present, pale in comparison to the support that “cheers, inspires and strengthens” the Lumád, like Binaton, who will be coming back, not to their communities, but to the evacuation centers.</p>
<p>“We are happy that we see so many people support us&#8230;among the media, church, students, and even local government units,” said Binaton. He is optimistic that soldiers will leave so he can again see his village, and see that their school reopen.</p>

<p>This year’s Manilakbayan was also visited by global activists who were delegates to the assembly of the International League of Peoples’ Struggles (ILPS). This exposed the Lumád activists to the fact that the fight to protect indigenous ancestral lands and the environment is being waged all over the world.</p>
<p>“Even other nations supported Manilakbayan, Mexico, India, even the US, where there are also indigenous peoples&#8230;all these encourage us, raise our spirits,” Binaton said.</p>
<p>Fanagel said they expect worsening attacks on activists, leaders and communities in Mindanao, specially after the Apec summit, when mining and agribusiness corporations will be more aggressive.</p>
<p>“Things will worsen, which calls for even more strengthening and broadening of the struggle and support to the people in Mindanao,” Fanagel said. But it will be harder for government to continue playing deaf, as more and more people in the capital will echo their calls. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>
