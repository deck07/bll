<p><em>Below is the unity statement of LODI, National Union of Journalists in the Philippines, AlterMidya People&#8217;s Media Network, Bulatlat, Kodao Productions, and Pinoy Weekly.</em></p>
<p>The arrest of Rappler CEO Maria Ressa on spurious cyber libel charges under suspicious conditions confirms that the Duterte administration has taken to twisting the law and legal processes to persecute its enemies. </p>
<p>The arrest near the close of day and subsequent events show it was meant to show the government’s capacity to orchestrate a full press against critics. There was no effort by Ressa or Rappler to evade the law. But when Rappler’s lawyers tried to post night bail, they were rebuffed by the judge tasked precisely to respond to unnusual circumstances. Indeed, the withholding of information and documents needed for bail, especially coupled with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) agents threats against journalists documenting the arrest, show clear malice. </p>
<p>We stand in solidarity with Rappler in the fight for press freedom and the people’s right to know. The incident is the latest of many attempts to discredit, tarnish, and demoralize and stop the Philippine media from doing its job. Part of the efforts to silence independent and critical media are the deliberate and persistent cyber attacks on alternative news sites Bulatlat, Kodao Productions, Pinoy Weekly and organizations Altermidya and National Union of Journalists of the Philippines (NUJP). </p>
<p>For the past weeks, our colleagues have been fending off denial of service (DDoS) attacks aimed at closing down the media outfits. Initial investigations point to the same group of attackers, using the same resources and techniques. We have every reason to believe that the DDoS attacks are the handiwork of Duterte’s minions. </p>
<p>The attacks are an affront against the ordinary people whose perspectives define the stories of the alternative media. These are attempts by those in power to drown out the voice of the marginalized and the oppressed, displaying Duterte’s fear of committed journalism that seeks to inform, educate and guide the public in decision-making.</p>
<p> We will continue to tell the truth and to defend whatever is left of our democracy. We take inspiration from that generation of journalists who bravely fought the dictatorship. It is our responsibility not only as journalists but also as Filipinos.</p>

They were branded as “henchmen” of the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army-National Democratic Front, and accused of being “terrorists” and “extortionists,” terms the military often uses to describe New People’s Army fighters.</p>
<p>Included in these posters are two Panay community journalists who are members of the AlterMidya Network of around 200 independent and alternative media practitioners throughout the country. The journalists are reporters John Ian Alenciaga of the online publication Panay Today, and Roxanne Javellana of Dampig Katarungan, a weekly show aired over DYOK Aksyon Radyo Iloilo 720.</p>
<p>By naming these community journalists as “henchmen” of those groups the Duterte regime has tagged as it enemies, the posters mark them as targets for violence. Human rights lawyer Ben Ramos was also vilified in a similar poster before he was brutally gunned down in Negros.</p>
<p>These community journalists are regular contributors to AlterMidya’s online newscast ALAB Alternatibong Balita. Their reports have highlighted the deleterious effects of the Jalaur mega dam on the indigenous Tumanduk of Panay; the loss of livelihood of workers and small entrepreneurs affected by the closure of Boracay Island; consumer complaints of overcharging in electricity bills in Iloilo City; and militarization in farming communities, among others.</p>
<p>Community journalists are crucial in bringing underreported issues in the regions to national and international audiences. They give voice to the marginalized whose grievances are often ignored by the corporate media.</p>
<p>Supposedly from a group called the “Panay Alliance of Victims of the CPP-NPA,” the posters are very likely the work of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, which is at the forefront of the vilification campaign against dissenters and critics of the government.</p>
<p>We denounce these attempts to intimidate and silence journalists, civic leaders, lawyers, and activists in Iloilo and elsewhere in the Philippines. These attacks on journalists must end. We need journalists to continue reporting on the state of human rights and other issues in these dangerous times. One journalist threatened is one journalist too many.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>LETTER TO THE EDITOR</strong></p>
<p>The Kalikasan People&#8217;s Network for the Environment (Kalikasan PNE) extends its highest commendation to Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) secretary Gina Lopez for her past 10 months of pursuing fearless and progressive environmental reforms under the rallying cry of social justice.</p>
<p>Lopez was clearly a victim of the pervading bureaucrat capitalism in government. The big mining oligarchs in the Commission on Appointments likely used millions of pesos in mining money to undermine Lopez&#8217; environmental crusade and ultimately move for the rejection of her confirmation as DENR secretary. Undoubtedly, the massive resources at the disposal of the Chamber of Mines of the Philippines and other big mining lobbyists played an insidious role in this coup for corporate greed. President Rodrigo Duterte said it himself: &#8220;lobby money talks.&#8221;</p>
<p>We challenge Pres. Duterte to walk his talk of urging legislators to &#8220;hear the cries of Gina&#8221; by defying the patently partisan vote of the CA and immediately reappointing Lopez as DENR Secretary. Duterte must go the extra mile in continuing to work with Lopez against the dirty business-as-usual politics of big mining corporations and the mining oligarchs in government.</p>
<p>Duterte must ensure the continuity for the regulations and reforms that Lopez initiated. Through any means necessary, the Duterte administration must uphold the historic mining closure and suspension orders against the 28 destructive large-scale mining projects, the cancellation of 75 mineral production sharing agreements located in critical watersheds, and the ban on open-pit metallic mining. They must also continue the crackdown on big fishpens in Laguna Lake and ensure its ecological restoration.</p>
<p>In ensuring the continuity of environmental reforms and progressive leadership, it would be wise for Duterte to heed the counsel and support of the progressive people&#8217;s movement such as the Makabayan People&#8217;s Coalition. The people&#8217;s movement is from where Duterte&#8217;s most hard-working, resolutely principled, and pro-people, pro-environment secretaries, Welfare secretary Judy Taguiwalo and Agrarian Reform secretary Ka Paeng Mariano, hail from. It is also one of the biggest and most reliable allies of Lopez&#8217; campaign for the environment.</p>
<p>Among the major achievements pursued by Lopez as environment secretary is her bridging the question of the environment and the question of peace. By creating new venues for peace-making with the revolutionary National Democratic Front of the Philippines through cooperation in the rehab and development of mining-affected areas within their territories, Lopez demonstrated how to address the roots of armed conflict through genuine social and economic reforms.</p>
<p>Duterte, who has shown commitment in constructively pursuing the peace talks with the NDFP, should realize that he will need not only a partner for change but also a partner for peace in the DENR. Forging the Comprehensive Agreement on Social and Economic Reforms (CASER) currently under negotiations in the peace talks will serve to mandate the pursuit of peace based on social justice, and also strike at the economic and political influence of corporations and oligarchs right in the heart.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it is up to the Filipino people especially in the frontline communities to bring the passion of Gina Lopez to life. We are the first and last line of defense against the attacks of corporations and oligarchs which use the full force of the unjust, pro-foreign and pro-corporate laws and policies against our communities and environment. We must intensify our resistance to destructive projects, programs, and policies as our act of defiance to the machinations of corporations and trapos.</p>
<p>Whatever fate has in store for Lopez, her indomitable fighting spirit will always be welcome in the pickets, barricades, and protests of the people against the destruction of the environment and plunder of natural resources. At the end of the day, it is the people’s collective action that topples oligarchs and plunderers. </p>

<strong><em>Duterte has opportunity to deliver on indigenous rights</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>By CARLOS H. CONDE</strong><br />
Researcher, Asia Division<br />
Human Rights Watch </p>
<p>MANILA &#8212; Hundreds of indigenous people marched in the streets of Manila on Monday, demanding respect for their basic human rights. They called for the government of President Rodrigo Duterte to drop trumped-up charges brought by the previous administration against 200 tribal minority rights advocates and urged that <a href="http://time.com/4028811/philippines-lumad-mindanao-indigenous-military-war-killings/">state-security forces stop committing abuses against tribal minorities</a>, particularly on the southern island of Mindanao.</p>
<p>Monday’s protest is the latest attempt by indigenous groups to seek justice and accountability for abuses against them. Indigenous groups often bear the brunt of human rights violations by state security forces in the Philippines, especially in areas with mining and plantation interests. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/09/23/philippines-paramilitaries-attack-tribal-villages-schools">One egregious attack documented by Human Rights Watch</a> occurred in September 2015 in the province of Surigao del Sur in Mindanao, when members of a military-backed paramilitary group killed the school administrator and two tribal leaders in Lianga town, in front of hundreds of terrified students and residents.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/01/28/philippines-illegitimate-encounters">Survivors of an August 2015 attack on Pangantucan town,</a> Bukidnon province, that left five Manobo tribal members dead implicated the military in those deaths. Since early this year, hundreds of tribal minorities have sought refuge in a religious compound in Davao City after fleeing their communities in Davao del Norte province because of abuses by military and paramilitary personnel. Tribal minority rights activists are particularly vulnerable. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/18/philippines-killings-environment-advocates-unpunished">Victims of alleged paramilitary violence</a> include tribal leader and environmentalist Jimmy Liguyon in Bukidnon province, killed in 2012, and Jimmy Saypan, secretary general of the Compostela Farmers Association, killed last week by unidentified gunmen in Compostela Valley province.</p>
<p>President Duterte has spoken out in defense of the rights of tribal minorities. In May 2015, while mayor of Davao City, Duterte called for an end to the killings of lumad tribal minorities. Since becoming president on June 30, 2016, Duterte has urged the return of indigenous peoples displaced in the September 2015 Surigao del Sur attack and welcomed tribal leaders to the presidential palace. </p>
<p>Duterte has an opportunity to deliver on his promises to protect the rights of indigenous peoples. But that will require him to take measures that he appears to have scorned in the ongoing “war on drugs”: enforcing rule of law, curbing security force abuses, and defending constitutional rights and freedoms. Until then, the suffering of the country’s tribal minorities is unlikely to end anytime soon.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/04/28/pooled-editorial-organize-organize/altermidya-for-web/" rel="attachment wp-att-77543"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/altermidya-for-web.jpg" alt="altermidya-for-web" width="640" height="451" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-77543" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/altermidya-for-web.jpg 640w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/altermidya-for-web-518x365.jpg 518w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Altermidya expresses grave concern over the House of Representatives’ (HOR) blacklisting of at least 50 individuals including sectoral leaders and activists, a journalism professor, campus journalists, and media liaison officers of national student organizations, among others.</p>
<p>A memo dated March 18, 2015 with the subject “Blacklisted/Banned Persons to the House of Representatives” issued by the HOR’s Legislative Security Bureau attacks freedom of expression, curtails the freedom assembly and association, and undermines the principle of government transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>It was only this May 2015 that the security memo was divulged after members of the house security unit enforced more constricting measures and disallowed the entry of those associated with the Makabayan bloc of progressive partylists. </p>
<p>Included in the list are University of the Philippines Diliman journalism professor Danilo Arao and College Editors Guild of the Philippines (CEGP) National President Marc Lino Abila. Arao and Abila are both columnists of Pinoy Weekly, a progressive newsmagazine published by PinoyMedia Center. Also in the blacklist are League of Filipino Students (LFS) Media Officer Charlotte Velasco and National Union of Students of the Philippines (NUSP) Media Liaison Officer and  Filipino Student Editor in Chief John Clifford Sibayan, among others.</p>
<p>Those in the blacklist allegedly violated the rules of the House regarding “decorum” and “proper behavior” for making political calls during conferences and sessions, and for displaying banners and placards that bore the general sentiments of  oppressed and marginalized sectors. These individuals were blacklisted without the benefit of due process. </p>
<p>Blacklisting individuals for expressing their views is directly violative if Article III Section 4 of the Constitution and is repressive and regressive, and reminiscent of martial law repression. We must never   forget that an insecure government afraid of criticism and dissent will utilize all violent and repressive means possible to remain in power, however illusory that power has become. These include the dissolution of the campus and alternative press, which, together with student councils and nationalist sectoral organizations, were a credible source of truth during the Marcos dictatorship and subsequent administrations.</p>
<p>Clearly, barring the entry of individuals into the House of Representatives is a curtailment of both the right to free expression and the citizen duty to monitor and hold government to account. While each person included in the blacklist has played a pivotal role in ensuring transparency and accountability in government, the blacklist also imperils the right of all Filipinos to express themselves. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, the media officers and campus journalists cover  House hearings from the people’s point-of-view, and help in informing the public on matters usually underreported or marginalized by dominant corporate-driven media. Many of those in the blacklist, including members of the academe, are also frequently invited by  different House committees to share their expertise on  the proposed legislation as key resource persons and credible sources of information.</p>
<p>Altermidya joins calls to review and lift the said security memo, in defense of the people&#8217;s  right to freedom of expression, assembly and a free press. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>His Holiness Pope Francis,</p>
<p>Greetings of peace and love from the Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) survivors!</p>
<p>Indeed we have the same wish: a wish of a poor church and for the poor&#8230; for we are the poor in the church.</p>
<p>In the spirit of mercy and compassion (the theme of your visit to the Philippines,) we are writing to you to express our gladness of your coming visit to Tacloban especially to the survivors of typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan); and to put across what is in our hearts. You are our father and we are your children, children of the storm. After the typhoon last November 8, 2013, many survivors were left with almost nothing and suffered in most difficult circumstances of hunger and deprivation.  Even before Typhoon Yolanda, our region of Eastern Visayas was the second poorest in the country, with other areas hard hit by the typhoon not far behind. We have been cast even deeper into the pit of poverty. Peasants and fisherfolk, workers and urban poor, the lowly paid professionals – we all feel the lack of land, industries, and progress. But, a few wealthy and powerful families are among the richest in the world.</p>
<p>Our lives are in ruins, Holy Father. We do not know to whom we can turn, because those in power do not see us nor respond to our cries.  Our government failed to help us during our darkest moment.  The people do not feel the trillion Philippine pesos in international humanitarian aid that the country has received.  Even one year after the storm, the Aquino government is not fulfilling their mandate to serve the people.  In fact, they have had no clear plan for helping the people get back on their feet and have relied instead on foreign aid and the profit-seeking private sector.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/yolanda-peoplesurge-photocourtesyoftudla-1.jpg"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/yolanda-peoplesurge-photocourtesyoftudla-1.jpg" alt="yolanda-peoplesurge-photocourtesyoftudla-1" width="640" height="427" class="alignright size-full wp-image-71185" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/yolanda-peoplesurge-photocourtesyoftudla-1.jpg 640w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/yolanda-peoplesurge-photocourtesyoftudla-1-547x365.jpg 547w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/yolanda-peoplesurge-photocourtesyoftudla-1-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>We still see no light, Holy Father. Though the government offers its RAY or Reconstruction Assistance for Yolanda, we struggle for our daily rice and fish.  The majority, who are peasants, fear for the future because measly government aid though agriculture is not adequate for this primary livelihood that suffered the most damage from the storm.  Many have no land, no work, no government services, and live in rags and hovels, under a continuing cloud of vulnerability to environmental and climate disasters.  </p>
<p>One year after Typhoon Yolanda ripped and ravaged our homes and communities, the Aquino regime remains deeply mired in a massive corruption scandal; many government officials are alleged to have pocketed billions of pesos meant for the people, while the storm survivors suffer hunger, disease and neglect.  Supposed government rehabilitation will go to infrastructure and other construction work. In contrast, many families have no homes and the rain and sun torment them in cities of tents and inhumane bunkhouses, alleged to have been constructed with corruption by the government. Those of us who live along the sea are forbidden to return to our communities because big businesses want to turn these into enclaves of expensive houses, resorts, casinos, and other profit-driven enterprises.</p>
<p>We know no peace, Holy Father. When the poor raise their voices to cry for justice and peace, the rich and powerful rulers are offended by our sound and continue to oppress us. These poor people are branded as communists. Two have already laid down their lives in the journey for justice for the survivors.  Many communities are under the rule of the gun wielded by the government.  Even as the Holy Father knows, the rich and powerful seek to hide the poor and deny our abject conditions.</p>
<p>We beseech the Holy Father to pray for us and illumine our struggle for justice and peace, equality and progress. We humbly appeal for an audience, so that we can pray together in solidarity with the poor and powerless struggling for life in their communities and standing for meaningful change. We pray with hope for a future where basic rights will be genuinely observed, so that all humanity may live and prosper on this earth.</p>
<p>Long live the Pope!!! </p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
People Surge<br />
(Survivors of Typhoon Yolanda or Haiyan in Eastern Visayas, Philippines) </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Pope Francis,</p>
<p>We, the Filipino youth welcomes with joy, justice, peace, and love His Holiness Pope Francis to the Philippines. Your writings and teachings inspire us to offer and commit ourselves to selfless and meaningful service to our fellow people, most especially the oppressed and the marginalized.</p>
<p>The Pope&#8217;s pronouncements for the poor are like manna that replenish our soul to continue our struggle for the poor and the oppressed. Thus, we were all passionate and jubilant when the news came that you will come visit our country this January. However, as much as we want to meet you in person and share to you our country&#8217;s realities and struggles, we won&#8217;t be able to do that, for it is the Philippine government that decides who will participate in the activities during your visit. It is in this context that we are writing to you, dear Holy Father, to share our struggles and the social realities that confront us each day.</p>
<p>No words can fully describe the magnitude of poverty in our country. While nearly every administration since the founding of the Philippine Republic has been quick to praise itself for stalwart economic management, growth has mostly been confined to the upper classes and their businesses, and has rarely, if ever, resulted in the creation of real, long-lasting, decent-paying jobs on the ground.  The national economy, geared as it is toward foreign markets and dependent on foreign investments and overseas Filipino remittances, has failed to develop thriving local industries. Nor has growth been inclusive. Profits of major corporations and CEO bonuses have soared while workers’ real wages have stagnated or declined over the decades.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with Italian paper La Stampa, His Holiness has correctly pointed out the existence of youths all over the world who are “neither working nor studying.” This is a prevalent situation in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Education has become a privilege rather than a right in our nation. Soaring tuition rates, coupled with the high cost of living, has made it close to impossible for many Filipino students to finish schooling. This situation has even been further aggravated by several government policies including the deregulated nature of tuition and other fees, dwindling state funding to public education, and anti-student policies such as the “no late payment” and “no permit, no examination” policy. These policies have hindered the youth from finishing school, and forced our families to work long hours just to get by.</p>
<p>Repressive labor policies from deregulation to contractualization have also left workers in vulnerable straits, unable to find decent employment should their contracts expire. Official government figures show that the combined ranks of the jobless and underemployed &#8211; some 10 -12 million Filipinos of working age – today make up 11 percent of the country’s total population. The youth comprises half of this figure.</p>
<p>While prices of basic commodities, including food, health services, and transportation continue to rise, our wages as young workers and employees remain miniscule and below living standards. The minimum wage in our country – 456 Philippine pesos – is less than half of the actual amount needed to have a decent life. Wages and salaries remain unchanged for years despite the roaring inflation, with the government content on knowing that our nation remains to be one of the major sources of cheap labor for the global economy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the youth in the countryside and the provinces continually suffer from landlessness and backward agricultural processes, a situation perpetuated by landlords who have remained vastly powerful both politically and economically. While a third – or about 9.7 million hectares of land – in the Philippines is agricultural, 70 percent of farmers still do not own the land they work on. The poorest sectors of Philippine society include small farmers and fisherfolk. Philippine agriculture is also the least mechanized in Southeast Asia, with the lowest subsidies for small farmers.</p>
<p>Inequality in the countryside is further aggravated by the sustained militarization campaigns of the government. Communities and schools in the farthest reaches of the Philippines are being used as garrisons, with many of our school children taking their classes under the shadow of imminent gunfire.</p>
<p>In cities, urban poor communities creep in the shadows of high-rise buildings, a testament to the huge gap between the poor and the rich. Urban poor communities, where many young workers and students reside, face threats of demolition on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Any mention of national development is incomplete without mentioning the full spectrum of civil, political, social and economic rights that should be guaranteed to all citizens regardless of class, status, religion, ethnicity or political inclination. Yet human rights in the government’s development plans are noted only in passing, and while the administration pays lip service to ‘’inclusive growth,” the facts on the ground speak of a different reality. Human rights defenders, trade unionists and activists of all stripes have long been assaulted on all fronts for their work.  Over a thousand cases of human rights violations have been recorded by human rights groups under Benigno Aquino III’s presidency. Over 400 political prisoners remain behind bars, with over 150 arrested under the current administration, many of them youth organizers and leaders.</p>
<p>Despite being a nation frequented by natural calamities, our nation has also remained vastly unprepared for such disasters. Our government has consistently shown its incompetence and utter neglect of the youth and people that suffered from recent typhoons, including Typhoon Haiyan. While state officials may show His Holiness a picturesque view of improvement and rehabilitation, they will most probably block you from seeing schools that remain without roofs, families still living in tents, and the depressing upshot of prostitution for food in some of the remotest areas of the Visayas and Mindanao regions.</p>
<p>This is the real story of the Filipino youth. This is the situation that the government will surely fail to show you, our dearest Pope. For while government officials regale you with stories of the nation’s supposed recovery, they will surely fail to tell you how the government itself is steeped in corruption. Our leaders themselves may paint a rosy picture of development, but they will fail to say that in recent years, the youth has actually resisted and fought against their corrupt practices that further undermined the Filipino people.</p>
<p>We are narrating to you our plight in the hope that you will help us and stand with us. When you spoke to the youth in Brazil, urging us “to be revolutionaries, to swim against the tide, to rebel against this culture that sees everything as temporary,” we took your words and engraved it in our hearts. When you told us “to learn to be on the side of the poor, and not just indulge in rhetoric about the poor,” we made it our marching call. Many of us that are writing to you are community organizers, youth leaders, and activists who have dedicated our lives in service of the Filipino people, in the hope that the youth can truly make a change.</p>
<p>Thus we humbly turn to you, Pope Francis, for help and guidance. May you stand with us as we continue the fight against this system of waste, this system that has left the youth to the clutches of poverty and hunger. As you visit our country, may His Holiness not only encourage the Filipino youth to continue the struggle for a better future, but also share to the world the plight of the Filipino people.</p>
<p>Help us, dear Pope, as we battle against inequality, as we fight for education, better social services, and for peace and unity in our nation fraught with war. May your blessed presence guide our leaders into ironing issues rocking the ongoing peace negotiations between the government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, and also spur the resumption of formal peace negotiations with the National Democratic Front of the Philippines. Help us achieve just and lasting peace by compelling the Aquino administration to honor its agreements with rebel forces, and addressing the roots of the ongoing Philippine insurgencies – which is societal inequality brought about by the current system that puts profit above people.</p>
<p>Journey with us, Pope Francis, just as Christ our Lord journeyed with the first Christians, and together, let us change the course of history. Together, let us live up to the words of Christ: “Faith without work is dead (James 2:14-26).” Stand with us, dear Pope, and together, let us spread the true meaning of mercy and compassion, and let us fill our nation and the world with the light of the Living Faith.</p>
<p>Yours in Christ,</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>January 15, 2015</p>
<p>Dearest Pope Francis,</p>
<p><em>Bienvenido! Benvenuto! Vi diamo il benvenuto con il collettivo abbraccio di maggioranza dellafilippina donne nelle Filippine</em></p>
<p>We thank you for coming to personally extend your compassion to a suffering people in the aftermath of the Yolanda disaster. May your visit pave the way for your deeper understanding of the Philippine situation particularly the impoverished condition of the majority of Filipino women. </p>
<p>We are your sisters who cannot find jobs in our own land and are forced to work abroad as domestic helpers or to be victimized as trafficked sex slaves, prostituted women or abused service workers. We are women who live in urban slums, who cannot even feed our children three decent meals a day. We are peasant women who toil over land monopolized by landlords.</p>
<p>Our daughters have been raped by politicians, soldiers, even priests and other persons in authority in our society. We ask you to join us in our quest for justice. </p>
<p>We are women who continue to suffer from massive displacement, illegal arrest and detention, torture and political killings due to President Aquino’s counterinsurgency program called Oplan Bayanihan.</p>
<p>We are mothers who have lost our loved ones in armed conflict and who long for peace based on justice.</p>
<p>We plea for your support for the resumption of peace negotiations between the Philippine government and the National Democratic Front. </p>
<p>Our government claims the Philippines is a women-friendly country because of laws that purportedly protect and uphold the rights of women. But what good are laws when poverty becomes the backdrop of increasing violence against women?</p>
<p>At least 13 Filipino women are victims of domestic violence every day and poverty prevents them from leaving their abusive husbands or partners. Gabriela Women’s Party, representing marginalized women in the national parliament, has filed the Divorce bill since 2004, yet to date, this bill remains in the dustbins of the parliamentary walls. We urge you to lend your voice and enlighten our government and church leaders to free our sisters trapped in abusive marriages because we are deprived of the option of divorce. </p>
<p>We call on you to look beyond the deceptions that President Aquino will unfold before you. He and his officials will paint a rosy picture of economic growth by building infrastructures that hide the real situation of poverty among our people or even by demolishing “unsightly” slum houses that they do not want to be seen. Our leaders refuse to free our nation from the injustices of massive unemployment, landlessness and pervasive government corruption. They are Judases who betray the people in favor of foreign and big business interests.</p>
<p>We are moved by your humility and inspired by your simple lifestyle and continued pronouncements against social injustice.</p>
<p>We pray that you join us in our collective struggle to build a more humane life, free from oppression, violence and injustice.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Gabriela Women’s Party</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pope of the poor, fight for us.</p>
<p>We are Filipino migrants, immigrants, refugees from all over the world who, together with our families, call upon Your Eminence, to bear witness to our struggle. We call on you to speak in behalf of overseas Filipinos in our quest for a better life. We have experienced first-hand human and labor rights abuses and exploitation. Hear our stories and join us in our fight against modern-day slavery.</p>
<p>Of present, an estimated 15 million overseas Filipinos are found in over 230 countries. Massive unempoyment, landlessness, poverty and globalization have been forcing our countrymen to migrate. There exists a widespread desolation, hopelessness and desperation that have caused the Filipino people’s diaspora.</p>
<p>Pope of the poor, fight for us. In your tenet to build “A Church without frontiers, mother to all”, we likewise reach out to you with open arms and hearts for our common objective to open the doors of Your Church worldwide in the spirit of genuine service to the people.</p>
<p>Like you, we stand firm that forced migration is an anomaly and a matter of deep concern involving the lives and dignity of our migrant workers. Ours is now an era of modern-day slavery wherein our migrant workers and their families are subjected to most cruel conditions in favor of greed for remittances and the desecration of human rights.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/pope-migrants.jpg"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/pope-migrants.jpg" alt="pope-migrants" width="640" height="469" class="alignright size-full wp-image-78100" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/pope-migrants.jpg 640w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/pope-migrants-498x365.jpg 498w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Pope of the poor, fight for us. We have seen the absence of legal frameworks that genuinely promote and protect the rights and welfare of our OFWs and their families. We have dissected and evaluated the efficiency or lack thereof of existing government programs and discussed ways to bring these to the concern of our authorities. We realize that the Philippines has many policies and laws on migration that need to be translated into concrete action.</p>
<p>We have seen that the continuation and intensification of the government’s labor export policy would only add more to the sufferings of our people, making them more vulnerable to human and labor rights abuses. We ask of you to speak out against this policy. We need to address the fundamental conditions of our society, especially the unequal distribution of wealth and work among nations which drives our people to forced migration.</p>
<p>Pope of the poor, fight for us. We agree with you that human trafficking is indeed “a crime against humanity”. It is a violation of our fundamental rights. It breeds the evils of discrimination, criminalization of undocumented migrants and all forms of violence, oppression and enslavement.</p>
<p>We are also greatly disturbed and moved by the tragedy of the separation of families. We cry for the sufferings and pains of children left behind and growing up without proper guidance, parents and couples estranged from each other, and the resulting economic, emotional and psychological implications of loved ones being uprooted from their families.</p>
<p>We call on you to work hand in hand with migrants’ organizations and advocates in support of the plight of our Filipino migrants. There are still many things that need to be done. Pope of the poor, fight for us.</p>
<p>We call on Your Eminence, that through Your Office, you can help us in organizing and broadening our reach and making our voices resound. There is a dire need to consolidate our efforts in various parts of the world. Together, let us face the challenge of holding the cause of Filipino migrants and their families.</p>
<p>Pope of the Poor, fight for us. In the spirit of service to the people, together, let our aspirations and advocacies be realized.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Pope Francis,</p>
<p><em>¡Bienvenido a las Filipinas!</em> Welcome to the Philippines! By now, I’m sure you’re already flooded with messages poured upon you by my fellow Filipinos. Thus, my voice will be just another amongst the crowd.</p>
<p>My voice comes from a place of complex stories, identities, ideologies, and perspectives. I am an agnostic theist. I am gay. I am highly critical of how your church treats LGBT people and women. I am also highly critical of the Philippine government and of government as a general concept, whether applied to a state or to a religious group.</p>
<p>This is nothing random. I am all of these mostly because of what I have gone through. Just like Jesus, I grew up without a biological father. The difference is, Jesus was raised by Joseph and Mary, while I was single-handedly raised by my mother. The circumstances I was forced into cemented my views about my country’s government. You see, my father was a human rights activist. Just like Jesus, my father was very poor. He had no interest in self-enrichment. All he aspired for was to liberate other people from poverty. But he was taken away from me by the government without justifiable reason. As if to add insult to injury, he was abducted on fathers’ day.</p>
<p>The enforced disappearance of my father effectively turned my family into a “non-traditional family.” And this, given the conservative culture in the Philippines, is not an easy situation for a very young child. My circumstances were further complicated as I grew up trying to come to terms with my sexuality. In many ways, I am farthest from what may be traditionally considered a “good Christian.” There is, therefore, very little incentive for me to communicate with someone like you.</p>
<p>But today, I am writing you simply as a son who grew up without a father, a son of a desaparecido. I am writing you because I acknowledge the influence you hold. I am writing you because I know the phenomenon of enforced disappearance is something your country also struggled with. Finally, I am writing you because I believe you will listen.</p>
<p>My request is simple; please do everything in your power to convince our president to sign and ratify the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons Against Enforced Disappearance (ICPAPED). It is an international treaty which is the fruit of the struggle of organizations like the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, the Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, and similar formations in various countries. It is an international agreement championed by the government of your country.</p>
<p>You have claimed time and again that you are pro-poor. My request, therefore, is aligned with your principles. How? In the Philippines, an overwhelming majority of victims of enforced disappearance come from basic sectors of society. Not only are poor people the most vulnerable to enforced disappearance, poor people are also driven deeper into poverty when a member of their family is forcefully ‘disappeared’ or abducted. Therefore, by helping us take steps towards ratifying the Convention, you are also helping the poor.</p>
<p>If you accommodate this request, I will not suddenly become heterosexual nor will I suddenly convert to Christianity. Besides, I know that your goodwill does not come with corresponding conditions. Yes, there will still be fundamental differences between our principles. I will continue to be critical of the government and the church hierarchy. I will continue to believe the love I celebrate with another man is not sinful. I will continue to be the many things I have always been.</p>
<p>However, I will forever be respectful of you as a fellow human being. I will forever admire your progressive leadership as head of the Roman Catholic Church. And most importantly, I will forever be proud of the fact that you and I have shared a moment in fighting for human rights.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Ron de Vera<br />
