<p>(1st in a series of 3: DENR in Mock Battle for Manila Bay rehab?)</p>
<p><strong>By MARYA SALAMAT</strong><br />
<em><a href="http://bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p><em>This is one of the reports in a series produced by Bulatlat.com with the Asia-Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development <a href="https://apwld.org">(APWLD) Media Fellowship</a>. The series aims to report on linkages between gender, ecological conflicts and climate change.</em></p>
<p>MANILA – If there are groups of Filipinos whose daily life confronts the most immediate impact of climate change, the fisherfolk are among those at the forefront. Their families live by the sea, on the banks of rivers and on islets that shrink or expand with the tide.</p>
<p>They are the first to face the consequences of sea levels rising more than usual, when the typhoons that brew from the seas are more disastrous, or when currents are hitting the land more brutally after some natural guards or breaks had been defaced. For example, after 600-plus old-growth mangroves were cut in April last year, there were changes in the water and they felt it immediately in their reduced catch.</p>
<p><strong>How the poor fisherfolk cope with changing climate</strong></p>
<p>In the coastal communities fronting Manila Bay in Bulacan, “climate change” is not a household word but they grapple with coping solutions in their daily life. One ready example, they have to more frequently repair and raise their embankment or their “waterwalk”.</p>
<figure id="attachment_106664" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-106664" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20180928_173911_women_hanging_outOn_thefoot_bridge_dl.jpg" alt="Bulacan rivers" width="640" height="426" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20180928_173911_women_hanging_outOn_thefoot_bridge_dl.jpg 640w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20180928_173911_women_hanging_outOn_thefoot_bridge_dl-548x365.jpg 548w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/20180928_173911_women_hanging_outOn_thefoot_bridge_dl-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Project Walkway</figcaption></figure>
<p>Living on narrow strips of land above water, dry space is scarce and to extend the living areas they build houses on stilts, connected by walkways fashioned from strung-together poles of bamboos. Less than a meter in width, the walkway loops around their island-homes, their collectively-built adjustment to the fact that the island is not wide enough.</p>
<p>From another sitio or sub-village, in a separate interview, an elderly woman recalled how, years earlier, they had more earthen embankments. The sitios were connected by more levees unlike today. “We could walk from one sitio to another in those days,” said Flor P. Salvador, 77, a resident of Taliptip since 1969. Now they have to ride a banca just to visit neighboring sitios.</p>
<p>In the bigger island-village of Binuangan, Obando, the walkway is more easily worn out not just by the trudging feet but by the higher water levels and stronger currents. Similar to what they have to do with their houses, they have to raise it by piling more wood or bamboo on top of the old parts.</p>
<p>Some families rebuilt their home using concrete and cement. It protects them better during storms. “Our houses don’t just get swept away or destroyed,” an old fisherman told <em>Bulatlat</em>.</p>
<p>But such a house on islands barely above water can also sink faster if the ground underneath it is liquefying faster than its neighbors.’</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106667" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sinking_houses_Bulacan_manila_Bay.jpg" alt="liquefaction in Bulakan" width="480" height="640" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sinking_houses_Bulacan_manila_Bay.jpg 480w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/sinking_houses_Bulacan_manila_Bay-274x365.jpg 274w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>In the coasts of Bulakan, Bulacan, the communities are scattered over rivers and shallow loam soil narrower than Salambao or Binuangan of Obando.</p>
<p>Despite all these, the people here have adjusted to living with the river and the bay. They are proud to say they are feeding themselves and their families, sending their children to school without asking much from the government. They contribute to the country’s need for relatively affordable fresh fish, shells and crabs.</p>

<p>They are in position to raise the alarm when the precarious balance of this ecosystem of rivers, islets and the bay was tinkered with, like when about a hectare of mangroves was felled in April last year. In the following visits of typhoons, <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/10/18/cutting-of-old-growth-mangroves-result-in-heavier-floods-in-taliptip/">they reported its worrisome results</a>. Various sitios of Bulakan, Bulacan suffered unprecedented flooding and soil erosion.</p>
<p><strong>Compounding problems</strong></p>
<p>Years before, these fisherfolk had fought to stop the privately owned but government-backed “sanitary landfill” from operating by the coasts of Manila Bay in Obando. It was a fierce struggle that older residents now say only the reign of terror of former army major Jovito Palparan under the former Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo administration enabled its forced operation. Some fisherfolk leaders and organizers in the area had been reportedly abducted, tortured and killed. The residents petitioned against it in court but in 2014 the Court of Appeals junked their petition and allowed the dumpsite to continue.</p>
<p>Kimberley Lazaro, 31, a resident of coastal Obando since birth, said that since the dumpsite was allowed, their fish catch has dwindled. They lost the mussels and crabs that used to abound at the muddy banks of the river. For a fisherwoman like her, it means spending more to go farther out on the river or the bay itself to catch fish.</p>
<figure id="attachment_106670" style="width: 543px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-medium wp-image-106670" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4558_DLwomen_defending_fisher_grounds-543x365.jpg" alt="fisherwoman in Bulacan" width="543" height="365" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4558_DLwomen_defending_fisher_grounds-543x365.jpg 543w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4558_DLwomen_defending_fisher_grounds-768x516.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4558_DLwomen_defending_fisher_grounds-840x564.jpg 840w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4558_DLwomen_defending_fisher_grounds-272x182.jpg 272w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4558_DLwomen_defending_fisher_grounds.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Fishing for her daughter, Kimverly wants a genuinely rehabilitated Manila Bay including the rivers draining to it.

<p>“If you didn’t start out living around here, you could not endure the stench and the flies. You will eat under a mosquito netting,” she told her fellow fisherfolk as they convened the network opposed to the planned reclamation in Bulakan.</p>
<p>A lesson they have learned through years of forced landfills and reclamation along Manila Bay: this exacts a price and some are not as predictable as worsening pollution and dwindling fish catch. Their part of the coast in Obando now stinks, the river is more polluted, their communities are more vulnerable to flooding, erosion, and subsidence. Worse, these same poor fisherfolk are frequently the government’s scapegoat whenever they seek to push their brand of development of the bay.</p>
<p>Now the coastal communities’ initial efforts to cope, by themselves, with direct impact of climate change and worsening pollution while they shore up their communities and sources of livelihood are coming into conflict with government thrusts concerning the bay.</p>
<p>Ironically, while the government is riding on the popular call for cleanup of Manila Bay and harnessing free labor of volunteers for fishing out thrash that washed up in Manila Bay, it is, on the other hand, disproportionately blaming the poor and seeking their demolition in favor of reclamation plans and other real estate development.</p>
<p>Environmentalists Kalikasan PNE and national fisherfolk group Pamalakaya cited the study of Ocean Conservancy in 2015 that 74 percent of plastics that ended up in the sea came from previously collected garbage. Another cause of pollution in Manila Bay, they said, is the failure of government itself to provide a significant water and solid waste treatment and management.</p>
<p>Environmentalists and fisherfolk decry the seeming duplicity of dubbing the battle for Manila Bay as for rehabilitation when the government is pushing for projects such as massive reclamation and commercial developments of the Manila Bay. Toward this, the government seems to be facilitating the rapid, forced displacement of the fisherfolk settlers in the Manila Bay.</p>
<p>In the coastal areas and rivers in Bulacan, <a href="http://r3.denr.gov.ph/index.php/86-region-news-items/419-denr-launches-massive-cleanup-of-manila-bay-in-c-luzon">there are 23,051 “informal settler families (ISF)</a>,” said the Manila Bay Coordinating Office (MBCO) of DENR in Central Luzon during a scheduled Manila Bay cleanup held in Obando.</p>
<p>But the DENR has been silent about the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA)-approved proposal of diversifying giant, San Miguel Corporation, to build an international airport on rivers, fishponds and mangroves in Bulacan along Manila Bay. This is more massive than the trash or the presence of ISF. It means burying the coast under million cubic meters of engineered soil and rock-cement. It means bringing in machinery for mega-construction and reclamation after the fisherfolk communities have been driven away.</p>
<figure id="attachment_106674" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-106674" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4614_fisherfolk_communities_earthen_embankment.jpg" alt="Taliptip, Bulakan" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4614_fisherfolk_communities_earthen_embankment.jpg 800w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4614_fisherfolk_communities_earthen_embankment-500x280.jpg 500w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4614_fisherfolk_communities_earthen_embankment-649x365.jpg 649w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4614_fisherfolk_communities_earthen_embankment-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4614_fisherfolk_communities_earthen_embankment-728x410.jpg 728w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4614_fisherfolk_communities_earthen_embankment-344x193.jpg 344w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4614_fisherfolk_communities_earthen_embankment-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4614_fisherfolk_communities_earthen_embankment-180x100.jpg 180w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">A typical narrow island-community, river on the right, fishponds on the left, under threat of being &#8216;cleared&#8217; for Manila Bay rehabilitation.

<p>It is not clear if the fisherfolk targeted for displacement by SMC’s reclamation project are also among the ISF complained by the MBCO in Region 3. What is clear is that since the locals began hearing about the San Miguel Corporation projects, the government and SMC have all but ignored their demands for information and a say in the future of the fishing grounds and the bay.</p>
<p>The locals say they would hear warnings that the SMC has a deep pocket and that they couldn’t win their demand to retain the fishing grounds as such. From October to November last year, a contractor company of SMC called Silvertides conducted surveys and interviews in coastal villages of Taliptip and Bambang. Around the same period, the locals were being told by this or that local government executive that they shouldn’t join groups criticizing the project.</p>
<p>The locals would only learn this February that the surveys and interviews of 30 “fishpond caretakers” Silvertides said they conducted were requirements for the SMC contractor to get the DENR nod for reclamation.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the fisherfolk were receiving news affecting their future only in trickles, in October some of them braved it out to establish the Network Opposed to Reclamation/Aerotropolis.</p>
<p>In November, fisherfolk, church workers, and environmental activists from Bulacan to Cavite gathered at the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) to <a href="http://kalikasan.net/articles/green-groups-urge-denr-to-deny-clearance-to-manila-bay-reclamation-projects/">file a Manila Bay-wide complaint </a>calling on the Duterte government. They asked the DENR to deny erring land reclamation projects their environmental compliance certificates (ECC) and area clearance permits.</p>
<figure id="attachment_106675" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-106675" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4365_river_isthe_highway_bulacan_manila_bay.jpg" alt="river in Bulacan" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4365_river_isthe_highway_bulacan_manila_bay.jpg 640w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4365_river_isthe_highway_bulacan_manila_bay-500x280.jpg 500w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4365_river_isthe_highway_bulacan_manila_bay-344x193.jpg 344w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4365_river_isthe_highway_bulacan_manila_bay-400x225.jpg 400w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/IMG_4365_river_isthe_highway_bulacan_manila_bay-180x100.jpg 180w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The river is the main thoroughfare for fisherfolk families living in coastal parts of Bulakan (Photo by M. Salamat)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In a statement, Leon Dulce, national coordinator of the Kalikasan People’s Network for the Environment (Kalikasan PNE), said, “not one of these reclamation projects have passed key international human rights guidelines such as the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines.”</p>
<p>These guidelines for businesses include compliance to civil, political, and socio-economic rights policies in the Philippines, adopting internal human rights policies and contributing to the implementation and development of State policies, conducting due diligence in assessing and addressing rights concerns, and cooperating with legal remedy mechanisms.</p>
<p>Gauging from reports of affected locals from Cavite to Manila to Bulacan, the reclamation projects, said Dulce, have apparently grossly bastardized the public participation mechanisms and environmental regulations of the Environmental Impact Assessment process. The group also blasted the reports that critics of reclamation were being harassed.</p>
<p>Asking the DENR to side with the fisherfolk against reclamation, they reiterated that “There is no reason not to respect democratic procedures, even for the aerotropolis that is an unsolicited proposal not yet governed by the formal regulatory process of the State.” <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>In this four-part series, <em>Bulatlat</em> looks into the implications of the impending enactment of the Rice Tariffication Bill (RTB) on the Philippine rice industry and its impacts on farmers, consumers and other stakeholders.</p>
<p>The RTB is a commitment of the Philippines to the World Trade Organization (WTO). It removes the quantitative restrictions on the importation of rice and paves the way for unbridled importation of the country’s staple food.</p>
<p>Contrary to proponents’ claim that the RTB would bring down the price of rice, historical data show that the price of rice in the world market has been unstable. Since the country started importing rice from neighboring countries, the price of rice has continued to increase.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2019/01/20/rice-price-hikes-seen-with-tariffication-bill/"><strong>Part 1: Rice price hikes seen with tariffication bill</strong></a></p>
<p>Farmers fear the beginning of the end of the Philippine rice industry with the passage of RTB. The agriculture sector, which has long been neglected by the Philippine government, stands to suffer from the government’s subservience to the dictates of WTO.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2019/01/20/tariffication-to-worsen-dependence-on-imported-rice/"><strong>Part 2: Tariffication to worsen dependence on imported rice</strong></a></p>
<p>More than 4,000 employees of the National Food Authority are expected to lose their jobs as RTB repeals the agency’s responsibilities and functions, including those that aim to protect the consumers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2019/01/20/rice-tariffication-detrimental-to-nfa-consumers/"><strong>Part 3: Rice tariffication detrimental to NFA, consumers’</strong></a></p>
<p>Farmers and advocates have provided alternatives to save and improve the sorry state of the Philippine rice industry and the country’s agriculture sector in general. Unfortunately, those in power choose to ignore these doable proposals.</p>

<p><strong>By MARYA SALAMAT</strong></p>
<p><em>This is a special report in a series produced by Bulatlat.com with the Asia-Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development <a href="https://apwld.org/">(APWLD) Media Fellowship</a>. The series aims to report on linkages between gender, ecological conflicts and climate change.</em></p>

<p>MANILA – Right now, tourists are likely enjoying a walk or sightseeing by the <a href="https://www.traveling-up.com/travel-guide-tanay-rizal/">river of Daraitan in Tanay, Rizal</a>, a mountainous province east of Manila. The clear water and the way huge slabs of rocks have been cleaved by the raging river, creating a challenging trek and a beautiful sight, and caves with pools of cool water inside, have attracted campers and backpackers to the villages around it especially in summer.</p>
<p>Inside one of the many caves <a href="http://ibon.org/2018/11/first-basket-projects-under-chinas-oda/">in Rizal and Quezon </a>the indigenous peoples, the Dumagat and Remontados, pray to their God, the creator they call Makijapat. The Dumagat live by planting food crops in the mountains, fishing, and hunting. The mountain forest and the watershed are key to their survival and also of those downstream. The mountain range has historically served to break or weaken strong typhoons and absorb excess water runoff. Given the grim forecast on climate change, its effects of generating some increasingly strong typhoons, or intense droughts, the Sierra Madre mountain range needs all the protection it can get to maintain or expand its forest and watershed.</p>
<p>But the indigenous peoples’ villages and the others farther upstream are in danger of losing it and all that the river sustains to mega-dam projects. The Dumagat and Remontados stand to be the most immediately affected – they are the first to be displaced. In fact, some of them are already bearing the brunt of the dam projects even as construction has been repeatedly stopped. The next to be affected are the farmers and communities downstream who would have to live with reduced guards against the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>What the people in Quezon and Rizal have opposed and stopped successfully for four decades now since the Marcos dictatorship <a href="http://ibon.org/2018/11/dutertes-infrastructure-miracle-resurrecting-a-damned-project/">keeps resurfacing as a threat.</a></p>
<p>The Duterte government’s “Build Build Build” projects constitutes the latest threat. It includes as one of the priorities the construction of large dams such as the Laiban dam, the Kaliwa (left) and Kanan (right) dams, or the Php12.2 billion <a href="https://ejatlas.org/conflict/laiban-dam-new-centennial-water-source-project-ncws-quezon-philippines">New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam</a>, which will be<a href=". http://ibon.org/2018/11/beware-of-onerous-china-oda-ibon/"> 85% funded by China</a>.</p>
<p>Last Nov. 20, the <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/11/21/groups-hit-treacherous-duterte-xi-jinping-meet/">Chinese leader visited Manila</a> and one of the agreements he oversaw was funding the New Centennial Water Source Project.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 15px;">Under the New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project, the Duterte administration targets to build the dams over more of the same rivers in Rizal and Quezon despite protests and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-46098118?SThisFB&amp;fbclid=IwAR2CGil0Tdin1LTfoUNjX84qjNKL_ORo9-lvJDIBL73W8Ya3L45rRbg2Niw">proven negative impacts of large dams</a>.</span></p>
<p>For Nanay Nene Baylon, the first Laiban dam project continues to exert a heavy toll on her family’s livelihood.</p>
<p>The Laiban dam was eventually stopped by massive protests in the 80s, but by then its massive twin gates had been forcibly constructed in their village. It has since deprived her family and that of other Dumagat of their years-long farm land. They were planting vegetables and root crops on the piece of land that became the cleared hilltop of the dam’s humongous gates.</p>

<p>Nanay Nene told us her family and neighboring farmers were neither compensated for the crops destroyed when the dam’s gates were constructed nor for the land that was taken away from them.</p>
<p>A young wife and mother at the time under the Marcos dictatorship, she said the construction crew and machinery came without warning and despite their protests.</p>
<p>She recalled how their villages were suddenly choking in dust stirred up by trucks and machinery which were escorted by government soldiers. The river turned muddy as workers and machine crossed it, then burrowed into and exploded parts of the mountain by the river.</p>
<p>Now, Nanay Nene is older, but she remains emphatic for the struggle to stop the renewed drive to construct the series of dams.</p>
<p>The Laiban dam’s gates continue to be guarded by armed security. Two years ago, as news broke out that the dam project was being pushed by the Duterte administration, the guards of the unused dam gates stirred up anew the villagers’ outrage.</p>
<p>The guards fired at and killed two Dumagat farmers who just happened to take a shortcut going downstream &#8212; they passed by the dam’s gates.</p>
<p>Climbing to what was once the Dumagat’s farm but is now overgrown by grasses, and yes, dominated by the  thick concrete wall of the dam gate, Nanay Nene’s lips thinned as she recalled the days of the gates’ construction.</p>
<p>After the construction was halted, the communities by the river regained a portion of past tranquility, she said. The water became clear again. They planted food again, without fear, in other parts of the mountain further upstream.</p>
<p>But there is the ever-present threat that all this may end, as they keep hearing about the dam projects being repackaged or pushed again.</p>
<p>With other women Nanay Nene has taken to joining initiatives to oppose the renewed drive to build mega dams where they live and farm. To their community, it is a struggle not just for their right to the land and to their self-determination, but also a struggle to save the river, the remaining forest of Sierra Madre and the watershed in it.</p>
<p>It is a struggle demanding time, patience and courage, the other women admitted. They have to face not just their fellow Dumagat and the city people, but also the militarization and the fear that if they are not careful, they could end up divided and scattered like the jagged rocks pushed apart by the Tinipak River.</p>
<p><strong>Learning from dam Lessons</strong></p>
<p>The Dumagat communities and the Filipinos in general have by now numerous <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2009/10/17/dam-nation-a-bloody-history-of-struggle-against-dams/">tragic experiences with dams</a>.</p>
<p>People from north to south have been displaced by earlier dam construction without compensation or rehabilitation. Rivers have become more polluted, farms have lost irrigation when they needed it most, and were inundated with excess water when they needed it the least. People have died from the dams’ sudden or heavy release of water in times of typhoons.</p>
<p>By now, scientists and environmentalists are saying, we should <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2018/03/14/heed-lessons-old-dams-china-dam-stakes-opposed/">know better not to resort to building more dams</a>. Add to this, the suspicions of progressives that the Philippines does not really need another dam.</p>
<figure id="attachment_105781" style="width: 577px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-105781" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/river_1IMG_3016_wl.jpg" alt="Tinipak in Tanay" width="577" height="433" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/river_1IMG_3016_wl.jpg 577w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/river_1IMG_3016_wl-486x365.jpg 486w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Tinipak River and Cave, part of what will be affected by planned dams under Duterte&#8217;s Build Build Build (Photo by M. Salamat / Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Progressive lawmakers in Philippine Congress led by Bayan Muna, Gabriela, ACT, Anakpawis and Kabataan Partylist, said the news of water crisis hyped up in late 2016 is “manufactured to build up the necessity for the Kaliwa-Kanan-Laiban dams.”</p>
<p>Neither were the dam projects needed for energy because according to non-government thinktank Ibon Philippines, using data from the Dept. of Energy itself, there are enough sources of energy and it could still be increased beyond the Philippines’ projected needs if the current dams were rehabilitated.</p>
<p>With global warming and climate change, normal or extra-strong typhoons are becoming more disastrous than ever, offering more pressing reasons not to destroy the remaining forest and watershed to build unnecessary mega-dams, said the group AGHAM (Science for the People and Center for Environmental Concerns).</p>
<p>Dams have not brought the people cheaper and reliable energy, nor irrigation, as promised when the first dams were built, said peasant woman leader Zenaida Soriano of Amihan on another occasion.</p>
<p>She has seen in peasants’ lives across the country how dams have wrecked the rivers and the environment, harmed the people’s agricultural practices and killed hundreds of people in periodic flooding and flashfloods.</p>
<p>To this day, dam opponents are being surprised by bitter sharing that many had died from flashfloods without being reported in the news.</p>
<p>Danilo Peralta, 62, said some 317 died unreported as a result of sudden release of dam water in Umiray River in 2004. Today another dam, taking off from early 2000s when protests stalled it, is now being pushed to <a href="http://mwss.gov.ph/projects/sumag-river-diversion-project/">add to Sumag Dam in Umiray</a>, the river in the boundary of Quezon and Aurora.</p>
<p>Dams have privatized the control of river, water and energy, further making life more difficult to women struggling to feed their family.</p>
<p>In various fora, representatives of the Dumagat and others who have experienced dislocation due to dam-building recounted how water used to be available, abundant, sparkling clear and for free. That changed after they were pushed away because of the dam. Either they have to pay for water or they have to trek longer to find other sources of water.</p>
<p>The people displaced by the construction of Angat Dam, Sumag Dam and Pantabangan Dam have experienced it and are warning those about to become like them: “When the day comes that you are driven away by force, you will not only have to pay for water that used to be free – you might not even have livelihoods so how will you pay, and live?”</p>
<p>The Duterte government’s revival of dam projects that have long been opposed by a broad coalition of people is nothing short of a declaration of war on the people, the Dumagat women leaders said at the launch of a coalition opposed to New Centennial Water Source Project. To people like Nanay Nene, this war comes complete with military deployment and government agencies coming to their communities to “consult” and get their approval.</p>
<p>In some communities especially those likely to be enclosed in the planned dams in Quezon, young Dumagat women said the community members’ moves are being monitored and questioned by the military.<br />
Some villages are regularly visited by government soldiers, or they could see armed government troops circling the village. Whenever the villagers talk in groups, soldiers would come asking what the talk is all about.</p>
<p>In Umiray village where one of the dam projects will be built, the Dumagat women&#8217;s group <em>Imaset</em> complained that their fellow Dumagat have been forced to live in a hamlet condition under military control and surveillance.</p>
<p>&#8220;They cannot go to work the field and they frequently went hungry,&#8221; the women said of fellow Dumagat.</p>
<p>Shortly before they formed the <em>Imaset</em> last August, they went on a rescue and relied mission with other support groups of the indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>Amid the palpable intimidation generated by the presence of armed troops, some Dumagat are also more rapidly losing their land. A village health worker said part of the reason is also the Dumagat’s natural generosity. They don’t think twice about letting another person or family to plant on their land. They did not know that pretty soon, that person would claim the land, with a piece of paper, unlike in the Dumagat practice where eventually they leave the piece of land they planted with crops for some time to let it recover.</p>
<p>Another reason is the expansion of land ownership of wealthy individuals, a village health worker and also a tour guide said. When we visited their village in mountainous Tanay, Rizal, he pointed to men clearing a wooded part of the mountain along the newly built road to the Dumagat communities. He said these are hired farm workers by &#8220;new owners&#8221; of that land in the mountain.</p>
<p>In Sta. Ines, the last village of Tanay, Rizal going north that has parts being claimed by neighboring Gen. Nakar, Quezon, a Dumagat teacher told <em>Bulatlat</em> they only have certificates to their claim to the land, which is not yet a CADT (Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title). She noted that they seem to be losing the land to those with money who can afford to plant more crops over more land.</p>
<p>The health worker said the communities definitely welcomed the new road built in late 2018. He said this will make it easier for them to go down and sell their produce – but he hoped the road comes with agricultural aid. He feared the cost of transport cuts into  their earnings, prompting some of the Dumagat to give up parts of the land to others with a little more money to work the land.</p>
<p>With the government’s renewed drive to build dams over their communities, the Dumagat and Remontados are hearing promises again of life supposedly improving because of the dam. In Norzagaray, such promises had torn some indigenous families apart .</p>
<p>But “Let’s ask those displaced by Pantabangan Dam, Angat Dam and Wawa Dam,” Nico delos Santos, son of the murdered Dumagat environmentalist, Nicanor delos Santos, said in a roundtable discussion last September of leaders of communities to be affected by dam-building.</p>
<p>The young Dumagat has been urging fellow Dumagat and the public not to be taken in by “deceptive packaging” such as the projects being too small it’s called “baby” dams, and the supposed closure of watershed for preservation. In the latter, he said, the indigenous peoples are barred from entering the closed off watershed. But it is not really being reforested, Delos Santos said. It’s only being turned into a plantation of fast-growing trees eventually being harvested for logs and timber. As for the supposed “baby dams”, he said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The river is a continuing body of water. If you build a dam here and another beyond it and another upstream, these are no small dams at all but a large dam.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Like in past struggles against the dam project, the Dumagat women like Nanay Nene are adamant that they will not take this sitting down. On top of their household and production roles she and other Dumagat women have embraced the added responsibility of building unity among their neighboring villages and outside it.</p>
<p>The women see the need to counter what they call as false information being spread among the indigenous groups by government agencies who they said “should know better.” To them these agencies include the NCIP (National Commission on Indigenous Peoples).</p>
<p>The Dumagat and Remontado women are taking their role seriously in the bid to save the river, the environment and consequently their homes and life.</p>
<p>“We are not selfish, this is also your river, we also wanted you to sample the river,“ a Dumagat woman told Bulatlat. “You should see for yourself how beautiful the river is, how we have life because it’s there.”</p>
<p>Indeed, the Dumagat women are closely linked to the water – they use it for cooking meals, cleaning up, washing clothes, nurturing food crops. Lately they are also learning the ropes of ecotourism.</p>
<p>As the men are kept busy with work in the field, and they are more often accosted by government soldiers who invariably accuse those they see in the mountains as rebels, the women have taken it upon themselves to spread understanding and updates to the neighboring communities.</p>
<p>With the support of the men, they tell us the women are organizing and spearheading protest actions for the river. They make the most of the women’s natural disposition to talk and swap stories after the day’s work. With them active in the struggle against the dam, they have formed a women’s assembly called <em>Imaset</em>. And they have even come up with a song and unity dance calling on the “kadumagetan” (the Dumagat people) and everyone to unite and defend Sierra Madre. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p><strong>By ARNOLD PADILLA </strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA &#8212; The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) has recently released a <a href="http://news.abs-cbn.com/business/05/28/18/govt-tags-jollibee-dole-pldt-in-endo-fight" rel="noopener" target="_blank">list of 20 firms</a> that it said are engaged or suspected to be engaged in labor-only contracting. Some of the country’s largest companies topped the list, including Jollibee (14,960 workers); Dole Philippines (10,521); and PLDT (8,310).</p>
<p>Conspicuously absent in the list are known supporters of the Duterte administration. </p>
<p>One is SM, which is known for its chain of malls that hires thousands of contractual workers. According to Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III, SM was not included in the list because it promised to regularize a total of 10,000 workers. He said that they are “satisfied” already with the retail giant’s commitment. But still, such promise does not justify the absence in the DOLE list of perhaps the most notorious and known biggest employer of contractual workers in the Philippines.  </p>
<p>By its own account, the SM Group has more than <a href="http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/money/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">94,500 employees</a> which include various companies under the conglomerate engaged in banking, financing, property, retail, malls, hotel, resorts and entertainment. According to one estimate, <a href="http://www.pressreader.com/philippines/sunstar-cagayan-de-oro/20160814/281539405355126" rel="noopener" target="_blank">nine out of 10 SM employees</a> are contractual workers. </p>
<p>Another is San Miguel Corporation (SMC). The diversified conglomerate (with operations in food and beverages, packaging, fuel and oil, power, and infrastructure) is said to employ around <a href="http://www.pressreader.com/philippines/sunstar-cagayan-de-oro/20160814/281539405355126" rel="noopener" target="_blank">20,000 workers</a>, of whom only about 1,000 are regular workers.</p>
<p>What could possibly explain the exclusion of these giant conglomerates – two of the biggest not only in the Philippines but also in the Asian region?<br />
The obvious answer is their close ties with President Duterte.</p>
<p>Among the country’s major business groups, SM has been one of the most supportive to the current regime. Its top officials are among the select tycoons that share an <a href="http://news.abs-cbn.com/business/01/17/17/duterte-hosts-private-dinner-for-philippine-tyc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">intimate dinner</a> or <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/824775/big-business-group-to-join-duterte-in-china" rel="noopener" target="_blank">travel abroad</a> with the President to look for business opportunities, and <a href="https://www.rappler.com/business/168387-ayala-sm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">invited to government events</a> to show support to centerpiece Duterte programs like the “Build, Build, Build”. Along with state-run banks, SM Group’s <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com.ph/news-and-events/duterte-s" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BDO Unibank</a> is financing Duterte’s contentious modernization program for jeepneys. </p>
<p>Its officials have <a href="https://www.philnews.xyz/2017/05/henry-sy-d" rel="noopener" target="_blank">publicly defended</a> the controversial war on drugs and also offered the <a href="http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/08/28/16/abs-cbn-sm-to-carry-dutertes-anti-drug-a" rel="noopener" target="_blank">free showing</a> of government’s anti-drug ads in SM cinemas nationwide. They supported the administration’s warming up of ties with China even as the latter has occupied and militarized Philippine-claimed territories in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>SM was founded by the country’s only trillionaire Henry Sy Sr. who has been the <a href="http://business.inquirer.net/247290/12-richest-pinoys-p2-9-trillion" rel="noopener" target="_blank">richest Filipino</a> for over a decade now. Sy’s already massive wealth has been rising astronomically under Duterte – from just below US$14 billion in 2016 to US$18 billion in 2017 and further to US$20 billion in 2018. That’s almost a 54 percent increase in just three years.</p>
<p>SM aims to <a href="https://business.mb.com.ph/2017/06/07/6-filipino-billionaire-heirs-rise-with-duterte-shift-to-china" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cash in on closer Philippine-China</a> ties under Duterte. China is the world’s largest consumer market and the second biggest economy that could soon topple the US as number one. For Filipino oligarchs, the potential for profits is vast.</p>
<p>On top of the already seven malls it has in China, SM is building a “supermall” in the major port city of Tianjin (said to rival the size of the US’s Pentagon building) as well as residential projects in various key Chinese cities. With closer bilateral ties, Chinese tourists are also flocking the country, benefitting SM’s interests in resorts and entertainment. </p>
<p>An even more vocal apologist of the Duterte administration is SMC, especially its head honcho Ramon S. Ang. The SMC president was among Duterte’s <a href="http://www.rap/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">campaign contributors</a> in 2016 giving an undisclosed amount and perhaps other forms of support as Ang wasn’t even listed in the official Statement of Contributions and Expenditures (SOCE). Ang also <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/897906/smcs-ang-offered-duterte-a-jet-but" rel="noopener" target="_blank">offered to buy Duterte a private jet</a> (worth as much as US$65 million) that he could use as President while <a href="http://www.rappler.com/business/industries/142724-s" rel="noopener" target="_blank">donating Php1 billion</a> to the Chief Executive’s pet campaign, the war on drugs.</p>
<p>Like Sy, Ang’s fortune has also vastly grown in the past three years. From a reported net worth of US$1.21 billion in 2016, his wealth has <a href="http://business.inquirer.net/247290/12-richest-pinoys-p2-9-trillion%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank" rel="noopener" target="_blank">more than doubled</a> to US$2.5 billion in 2018. Duterte’s infrastructure push apparently also pushed up Ang’s riches, which also include interests in construction.</p>
<p>Like SM, SMC has been capitalizing on Duterte’s programs. SMC is among those most aggressive in expanding in Mindanao particularly in establishing vast plantations and constructing infrastructure. In partnership with Malaysia’s Kuok Group, the conglomerate is <a href="http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTLGA/Resources/MinLGAF_Synthesis_Report_Final_August_2016.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">developing about 18,495 hectares</a> of forestlands covering four Davao del Norte municipalities for oil palm production. Just last August 2016, SMC also opened a 2,000-hectare industrial estate in Malita, Davao Occidental that also has a 20-meter deep seaport that can accommodate container vessels. </p>
<p>SM and especially SMC are among the leading proponents in Duterte’s “Build, Build, Build” infrastructure development program, including through the <a href="http://ibon.org/2018/03/unsolicited-projec" rel="noopener" target="_blank">controversial unsolicited route</a>. SMC alone accounts for 53 percent (P1.59 trillion) of the cost of all unsolicited proposals (P3 trillion) that have pitched to the Duterte administration. These include the P700-billion New Manila International Airport; the P338.8-billion Manila Bay Integrated Flood Control, Coastal Defense and Expressway Project; and P554-billion expansion of the Metro Manila Skyway and the South Luzon Expressway (SLEX).</p>
<p>SM (together with the Ayala group), on the other hand, has submitted an unsolicited proposal to build a P25-billion 8.6-kilometer elevated toll road that will supposedly help decongest traffic along EDSA. But as SM itself admitted, the main objective of the toll road is to <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/print/article/283334" rel="noopener" target="_blank">increase access</a> to its Mall of Asia complex. Through its BDO Unibank, SM also aims to profit from the “Build, Build, Build” by lending to project proponents or operators.</p>
<p>One of the major campaign promises that Duterte made was ending “endo” (end of contract scheme or contractualization). But two years into his presidency, that promise has remained largely unfulfilled.</p>
<p>With the biggest employers of contractual workers like SM and SMC as Duterte’s biggest backers, that should not come as a surprise. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a>   </p>

<p>“This is an unfortunate development in our work for peace. Never before have we all reached this far in our negotiations with (the CPP/NPA/NDFP).”</p>
<p>By <strong>RONALYN V. OLEA</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></strong></p>
<p>MANILA – President Rodrigo Duterte has dropped any pretense to addressing the roots of the armed conflict. </p>
<p>After two rounds of peace talks between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP) and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) in 2017, Duterte eventually <a href="http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2017/11nov/20171123-PROC-360-RRD.pdf">terminated the peace talks</a> , <a href="https://pcoo.gov.ph/news_releases/duterte-declares-cpp-npa-terrorist-group/">declared the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and the New People’s Army (NPA) as terrorist groups</a> and <a href="http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/948628/philippine-news-updates-communist-party-of-the-philippines-new-peoples-army-president-duterte-peace-talks">ordered his men</a> to kill armed NPA guerrillas on sight.  </p>
<p>Duterte practically blocked the road to peace. He is repeating the counterinsurgency formula of previous administrations: ignore the roots of the armed conflict and crush the armed revolution through a militarist approach. </p>
<p><strong>Socioeconomic reforms went down the drain</strong></p>
<p>Whatever achievements gained by the GRP and NDFP panels went to naught. </p>
<p>In the January 22- January 26 talks in Rome, both parties projected the signing of Comprehensive Agreement on Socioeconomic Reforms (Caser) https://www.bulatlat.com/?s=Caser&#038;submit= and the Comprehensive Agreement on Political and Constitutional Reforms (CAPCR), the second and third substantive agenda in the GRP-NDFP peace talks, by yearend.</p>
<p>At a time when both parties have made breakthroughs in the drafting of Caser, including agrarian reform and rural development that will ease poverty and underdevelopment, Duterte chose to end the talks.</p>
<p>Presidential peace adviser Jesus Dureza himself said in his official statement: “This is an unfortunate development in our work for peace. Never before have we all reached this far in our negotiations with (the CPP/NPA/NDFP).”</p>
<p>Duterte’s turnabout came after U.S. President Donald Trump visited the country. The <a href="https://www.dailystarph.com/trump-reiterates-aid-for-marawi-city-rehab-ph-drug-war/">U.S. government</a> has provided $85 million for counterterrorism-related equipment, training, and support for the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and $65 million to “enhance the Philippines’ maritime security capabilities.” Trump also pledged $2 million for Duterte’s “war on drugs.”  </p>
<p><strong>Duterte’s wars bound to fail</strong></p>
<p>Instead of crushing the armed revolution, Duterte is fanning it with his copycat counterinsurgency program.</p>
<p>His misnamed Oplan Kapayapaan, like Arroyo and Aquino’s Oplan Bantay Laya, is characterized by extrajudicial killings of activists, trumped-up charges against development workers and dissenters, bombings and forced evacuation of peasant and indigenous peoples’ communities, among others. </p>
<p>As of November 2017, human rights alliance Karapatan has documented 113 victims of political killings, 81 victims of torture, over 54,000 victims of threat, harassment, and intimidation. More than 364,000 civilians became victims of indiscriminate firing and aerial bombing, and over 426,000 of forced evacuation. </p>
<p>The Duterte regime has also imprisoned 121 new political prisoners. </p>
<p>Duterte’s bloody “war on drugs” has made his administration more loathsome. </p>
<p>Duterte has failed to learn from the mistakes of previous administrations. A militarist approach won’t end the armed conflict. Until the social and economic causes of poverty and underdevelopment are addressed, the raging war continues. </p>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2017/09/06/lumad-students-vow-get-justice-slain-schoolmate/">Lumad student</a> who lost her classmate and driven away from her home said, ““It’s government that is teaching us to become rebels.” <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p><strong>By MARK AMBAY III</strong></p>
<p>On September 5, two paramilitary men shot Obillo Bay-ao, a 19-year old Manobo youth from Talaingod town, Davao del Norte. He was a Grade 6 student of the Salugpongan Ta’Tanu Igkanugon Community Learning Center (STTICLC), an alternative school FOR Lumad children in Talaingod. He was rushed to the hospital but died that same night.</p>
<p>Bay-ao was the latest victim of extrajudicial killings perpetrated against indigenous peoples all over the country. The Lumad, in particular, have in recent years experienced a severe government crackdown that has threatened the education of thousands of Lumad children.</p>
<p>President Rodrigo Duterte, who also hails from Mindanao, has publicly criticized the killings of the Lumad when he was still mayor of Davao City. during his inaugural speech in 2016, he promised to initiate a peace process that could ease back the militarization of indigenous communities.</p>
<p>But just one year after his inauguration, the supposedly sympathetic Duterte has already turned his back on his promises.</p>
<p><strong>The Lumad in the Philippines</strong></p>
<p>There are over 11 million indigenous peoples in the Philippines, which translates to at least 11 % of the population of the country, according to the National Commission on indigenous peoples (NCIP). Almost 60% of them live in Mindanao and are collectively known as Lumad. They are composed of 18 tribes which include the Manobo, Mandaya, B’laan and Subanen peoples.</p>
<p>The Philippines is a country rich in mineral resources, estimate in 2015 to be about $1 trillion worth of untapped mineral reserves in Mindanao alone. Most of these can be found within Lumad ancestral lands. Previous administrations have made extraction of these minerals a national priority, with the enactment of the Mining Act of 1995, and President Benigno Aquino III issuing Executive Order 79 (EO 79) in 2012.</p>
<p>The Mining Act allowed for large-scale foreign investments in the mining sector, while EO 79 gave the national government a final say in approving applications for mining permits.</p>
<p>The Liguasan Marsh, which is part of the ancestral domain of the Moro peoples in Mindanao, holds a large reserve of natural gas worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Some of the largest dams in the Philippines have also been or are currently being constructed in the island as well, including the Pulangi V dam, which threatens to displace thousands of indigenous peoples from their ancestral lands and would destroy their means of livelihood and way of life.</p>
<p>Despite these rich natural resources, many Lumad and other indigenous peoples in the Philippines remain mired in poverty. Violations against their rights are also commonplace. Indigenous peoples’ rights are supposedly protected by law through the <a href="http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1997/10/29/republic-act-no-8371/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indigenous peoples’ Rights Act (IPRA) of 1997.</a></p>
<p>The Philippines is also party to the <a href="http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/DRIPS_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous peoples (UNDRIP).</a> Though the IPRA and the UNDRIP are supposed to ensure indigenous people’s right to self-determination and control over their ancestral lands, the fact is that they still suffer from exploitation, grave human rights abuses, and lack of access to basic social services, like health and education.</p>
<p>The right to education is a globally-recognized fundamental right and is seen as a “multiplier” right, because it helps enable people to experience and fulfill other rights that they should enjoy as human beings. Education is also seen as means to break the cycle of poverty and better one’s condition. An educated populace benefits nations in general, as it leads to greater productivity, people making more informed choices, and more stable societies.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, although the government allocation for primary and secondary education has been increasing since 2013, only seven out of 10 children who enroll in primary school will complete it, while only four out of these seven will finish secondary school. Many children have no access to education to begin with.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.right-to-education.org/sites/right-to-education.org/files/resource-attachments/MRG_State_of_the_World%27s_Minorities_and_Indigenous_Peoples_2009_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minority Rights Group,</a> an international organization that focuses on securing the human rights of ethnic, national and gender minorities, the majority of out-of-school children in the world are indigenous.</p>
<p>The Lumad and other indigenous peoples in the Philippines face many challenges on accessing education. Government officials usually do not take into consideration the specific needs and interests of indigenous peoples when formulating policies. Also, indigenous peoples are more often than not the last to receive basic social services from the government, severely limiting opportunities for indigenous children.</p>
<p>Poverty is one of the main reasons why parents are discouraged from sending their children to school. <a href="https://psa.gov.ph/content/poverty-incidence-among-filipinos-registered-263-first-semester-2015-psa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In 2015, 26% of the country’s population lived below </a>the poverty line, while 12% lived in abject poverty and have to survive with less than $1 per day. Indigenous peoples make up a large bulk of those living in poverty. Many parents have to divide what little money they have for food, health and education needs of the family, with food often taking priority in household spending.</p>
<p>Indigenous children who do attend school, on the other hand, often have to endure walking many kilometers or crossing dangerous rivers and mountainous areas, exposing them to risks during travel. In addition, they often face deeply-entrenched discrimination in an education system that is not particularly responsive to the cultural needs and sensitivities of indigenous children, who are often treated as outsiders, outcasts, and second-class citizens.</p>
<p><strong>Alternatives</strong></p>
<p>Because of these difficulties and continuing government neglect for the needs of Indigenous peoples, the Lumad turned to NGOs to ask for assistance so their children can get an education.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/10/21/Alcadev-the-school-that-feeds-minds-and-communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alcadev, one of the pioneers</a> in providing education to indigenous children, was founded by Lumad organizations Kahugpungan sa mga Lumad sa Surigao del Sur (KALUNASS) and the Malahutayong Pakigbisog Alang sa Sumusunod (MAPASU) in 2004. Alcadev set up an alternative learning system to provide secondary education to Indigenous youth in the hinterlands of the Caraga region in northeast Mindanao, the southernmost major island in the Philippines. Alcadev provided “education relevant to their (Lumad’s) needs” and taught the children to use the education they received to help their tribes and communities. Since its founding, Alcadev’s students have achieved almost 100% passing rate for government equivalency exams that would pave the way for them to attend college.</p>
<p>The Center for Lumad Advocacy and Services (CLANS) started out as a non-government organization that partnered with the B’laan people in implementing a sustainable agriculture program for residents of Malapatan town, Saranggani in 2007. CLANS staff learned through their immersion in the community that the B’laans of the village did not know how to read or write.</p>
<p>Community leaders then asked assistance from CLANS staff in providing education to the B’laan children, and by early 2008, CLANS was already training two community educators to teach literacy and numeracy to the Lumad.</p>
<p>In cooperation with the Kahugpongan sa mga Lumad sa Halayong-Habagatang Mindanao (KALUHHAMIN), a Lumad organization that helps in identifying communities that need schools and other services, CLANS now operates over 50 schools in Far Southern Mindanao.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rmp-nmr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rural Missionaries of the Philippines-Northern Mindanao Region (RMP-NMR),</a> a regional chapter of the faith-based organization RMP, has been involved in land rights advocacy since 1969. In 2010, RMP-NMR started its Literacy and Numeracy Program (LitNum) upon the request of several Higaonon and Manobo Lumad communities in the region, and by 2014 it was operating schools in 17 Indigenous communities serving over 500 Indigenous children.</p>
<p>Another pioneer in providing education to Lumad children is the <a href="https://misfi-phil.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mindanao Interfaith Services Foundation, Inc. (MISFI),</a> which started holding literacy and numeracy classes for the Lumad in 1984. In 2007, with assistance from the European Union, MISFI built 20 community schools to provide alternative formal schooling for Indigenous children; today MISFI operates nine secondary schools and 22 primary schools for the Lumad in partnership with PASAKA, a Southern Mindanao-based Lumad organization.</p>
<p><strong>Tailor-fit</strong></p>
<p>The creation of these culturally-sensitive schools tailor-fit for the needs of indigenous peoples have had a profound effect on the Lumad and their communities. And they are now getting the education they need for free.</p>
<p>“My father and grandfather have always dreamed of getting my siblings and I a good education,” related Jomar, who is an 8th grade student in one of MISFI’s schools. His father and grandfather are both datu (tribal chieftain) of the Ata-Manobo tribe from Capalong, Davao del Norte and Jomar’s sister and brother are also MISFI students.</p>
<p>“When MISFI opened classes, I was one of the first students even though I was older than my classmates. I really wanted to learn,” he added.</p>
<p>And it’s not only children who benefited from education; the Lumad schools have held literacy and numeracy classes for adults, as well. Jomar’s adoptive mother and other members of his clan were also students of these classes.</p>
<p>“Amay (Mother) and I would read together at night so she could learn, too. She was so proud when she graduated from her class,” remembers Jomar.</p>
<p>And the schools have provided not just education to the Lumad, they also taught livelihood skills as well as sustainable agriculture practices and organic farming that helped ensure food security for indigenous communities.</p>

<p>Sustainable agriculture and organic farming is part of the curriculum developed by Alcadev and taught to its students and their parents. At the onset, many of the Lumad were not convinced with the new technology that were taught because, in their own words, “we grew up farming.”</p>
<p>However, as time went by, community members saw the benefits of these subjects for their community. For example, instead of the traditional slash-and-burn farming methods, they started gradually using sustainable and organic methods.</p>
<p>Increased production has also resulted from implementing sustainable agriculture practices. Han-ayan residents have so far increased production ranging from 38% in 2007 to 88% in 2013, according to one Alcadev document.</p>
<p>But the most important effect of these schools on the Lumad is far greater than simply increased production or learning to read and write.</p>
<p>“Before the school was established, we really undervalued ourselves and our capacities because we did not have an education,” said Marissa Tejanel, a student of the <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/10/30/defend-lumad-schools-our-beacons-of-hope/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fr. Fausto Tentorio Memorial School (FFTMS)</a> in White Culaman village, Kitaotao, Bukidnon. “But with the school and the teachers, it all changed.”</p>
<p>“Before, the Lumad did not know how to read and write. That is the reason why we persevere to have a school because we do not want anyone to step on us because we are illiterate,” she added.</p>
<p>Jomar said their school helped them regain their pride in themselves as Lumad and “united us in standing up and fighting for our rights.”</p>
<p><strong>Crackdown</strong></p>
<p>Despite all the benefits gained by the Lumad from having indigenous schools in their communities, Lumad schools have for several years faced attacks from the military and paramilitary groups.</p>
<p>On December 13, 2013, the Department of Education (DepEd) issued <a href="http://www.deped.gov.ph/sites/default/files/memo/2013/DM_2013_221.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memorandum 221,</a> which was based on the Letter Directive 25 of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP). The memo virtually allowed the use of schools by the military, said then Kabataan Partylist Rep.Terry Ridon.</p>
<p><a href="http://kabataanpartylist.com/blog/2014/01/29/new-deped-afp-memos-allow-military-presence-in-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ridon also said that the &#8220;DepEd memo and the AFP directive</a> were inimical to the protection of children’s rights. Allowing military presence in educational institutions is tantamount to increasing risks for children, especially those living in situations of conflict.”</p>
<p>Although the memo supposedly prohibits the use of schools in purely military operations, it does allow the use of school grounds for “civil-military operations,” which Cristina Palabay of Philippine-based human rights group <a href="http://www.karapatan.org/AFP%2C+DepEd+engage+in+doubletalk+in+guidelines+on+military+activities+in+schools+to+justify+AFP+attacks+vs+children+-+Karapatan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Karapatan said was just &#8220;double-talk&#8221;</a> for use of schools for military purposes.</p>
<p>“The memo is clearly being used by the AFP to enter schools for military purposes,” decried Palabay, adding that military operations against Lumad schools have resulted in “killings, torture and other rights violations, especially trained against those perceived to be the government’s enemies, and in the process have likewise resulted to direct attacks against children’s rights.”</p>
<p>Palabay was right on point. The Save Our Schools Network (SOS), an alliance of children’s and indigenous rights activists was formed in 2012 at the onset of attacks on Lumad schools under then-President Benigno Aquino’s term. The group has recorded at least 214 attacks on Lumad schools in Mindanao alone between 2012 and 2014.</p>
<p>Twenty other DepEd-run schools were also attacked or were used by the military as camps during military operations in the same period. Violations included military occupation and forced closure of schools, extrajudicial killings, vilification and red-tagging of NGOs and school staff, illegal arrests and detention.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2014/10/30/bakwet-%C7%80-militarization-triggers-evacuation-of-2000-lumads-in-surigao-del-sur/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some 1,800 Lumad were forced to flee</a> their homes due to a series of killings, harassment and school-and-house burnings that happened in Lianga, Surigao del Sur on October 24, 2014. Henry Alameda, a chieftain from the Manobo tribe, had just finished eating when armed men barged into his home and dragged him outside his house, where he was shot in the head and the chest.</p>
<p>At 4 PM of the same day, shots were fired at the house of Alejandro Dumaguit in San Lorenzo village of the same town. Dumaguit’s son died due to gunshot wounds while Dumaguit himself and his two other children were also wounded. Two school buildings run by the Tribal Filipino Program of Surigao del Sur (TRIFPSS) were also set on fire by suspected members of the military and the Bagani paramilitary group which has ties to the AFP.</p>
<p>On March 11, 2015, <a href="http://davaotoday.com/main/politics/257-households-encamped-by-army-ops-in-talaingod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">soldiers encamped inside the buildings</a> of two Lumad schools located in villages in the hinterlands of Talaingod, Davao del Norte. They entered residents’ homes without permission and branded several community members of being members of the NPA (New People’s Army), a charge the residents denied. The school, run by the Salupungan Learning Center, had to postpone student activities due to the military encampment of their buildings.</p>
<p>On Aug. 30, 2015, military forces arrived at the village of Han-ayan in Lianga, Surigao del Sur and encamped on the school grounds run by Alcadev. Residents were roused by the military and members of the Magahat-Bagani paramilitary group and were herded to the village basketball court where they were told they would be killed if they did not leave the village in two days. Dionel Campos and Datu Juvello Sinzo were then shot by the Magahat-Bagani in front of the frightened residents. That same morning the body of Emerito Samarca, Alcadev director, was found inside the dormitory provided by Alcadev for its teachers with his throat slit. This triggered the evacuation of some 2,000 Lumad in the area.</p>
<p>Just over one month later, on Nov. 12, 2015, armed men believed to be members of the military and the Magahat-Bagani paramilitary force also burned down another school building run by Alcadev in Sibagat, Surigao del Sur.</p>
<p><strong>No let up</strong></p>
<p>In an unprecedented move in 2016, Duterte invited progressive leaders including Lumad and other indigenous rights activists for a meeting at the Malacanang Palace immediately after his inauguration as the country’s chief executive.</p>
<p>Yet attacks on Lumad schools have continued under the present administration. Between July 2016 and July 2017, the SOS Network documented at least 68 attacks that affected 89 Lumad schools and over 2,500 Indigenous children. Ironically, 80% of the attacks happened in the southern Mindanao area which is Duterte’s home region.</p>
<p>In October 2016, local police of Palimbang, Sultan Kudarat <a href="http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/588803/probe-sought-on-red-tagging-of-lumad-schools-in-sultan-kudarat/story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started hanging streamers around town that labeled CLANS</a> as the “entry-point of deception of the NPA” and that the schools were “fake and illegitimate.” Residents in a village were gathered in a meeting and municipal officials repeated the allegations against CLANS. Municipal officials also started distributing fliers to town residents promising a PhP5,000 reward for anyone who can produce pictures of CLANS staff. The said NGO had to suspend classes for 20 schools due to the vilification campaign, which was allegedly spearheaded by the town mayor in partnership with local police and military authorities.</p>
<p>On July 6 this year, residents of Han-ayan had to again flee their community when soldiers were sighted near the village. Residents reported hearing military helicopters circling the community, fueling fears of a repeat of the 2015 grisly killings. Over 2,000 Lumad fled Han-ayan, including teachers and students. More than 700 Lumad students were affected. The residents had barely rehabilitated their communities after returning from a one-year evacuation in September 2016.</p>
<p>Harassment, trumped-up charges and vilification campaigns against teachers and students of Lumad schools are also commonplace. MISFI and STTICLCI were prevented from operating schools for the Lumad in 2015 when the regional DepEd office in southern Mindanao <a href="http://davaotoday.com/main/economy/education/still-no-permit-for-ip-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused to grant them permits </a>to operate their schools. Paramilitary groups barred MISFI teachers from travelling to Sitio Muling in Capalong, Davao del Norte where one of their schools was located. In addition, DepEd regional officials recommended the replacement of MISFI teachers with military personnel as &#8220;para-teachers.&#8221;</p>
<p>In December 2015, <a href="http://www.karapatan.org/Community+leaders%2C+teachers+of+Lumad+school+in+CARAGA+harassed+with+trumped-up+cases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charges of trafficking and child abuse were filed</a> against teachers from Alcadev and parents from MAPASU. The complainant, a Lumad woman, alleged that Alcadev&#8217;s staff were allowing the students of Alcadev to be trained as NPA members. Human rights activists believe the complaint was instigated by military officials given that the complainant was the common-law wife of a soldier who was at that time deployed in the area.</p>
<p>Most recently, in September 2017, military officials filed charges of murder and frustrated murder against six volunteer teachers of CLANS supposedly in connection to the killing of a soldier and the wounding of nine others in Kalamansig, Sultan Kudarat. The six volunteer teachers and seven other people were accused by the military of being involved in the incident as NPA rebels or supporters, something that they and human rights groups have denied. Thirty-three schools run by CLANS have been forcibly closed down as a result.</p>
<p>&lt;strong&lt;“I’ll bomb you.”</p>
<p>Despite promises of change and peace, it seems the present government is keen on continuing the policy of repression the Lumad have experienced from the past administrations.</p>
<p>During a speech in June 2017, former military officer and now Magdalo partylist <a href="http://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/regions/08/18/15/70-pct-npa-mindanao-are-lumad-magdalo-solon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rep. Ashley Acedillo</a> said in 2015 that 70% of the NPA are from the Lumad, a claim that has been repeated by other government and military officials since then, with even Duterte expressing belief in the statement.</p>
<p>Government and military officials point to Lumad schools as one of the reasons for this occurrence, alleging that the schools are breeding grounds for subversion and that these schools are actually being run by the CPP-NPA and are being used by the Maoists for recruitment.</p>
<p>The NPA has been “using Lumad schools for indoctrinating, agitating and recruiting new cadres,” claimed AFP public affairs chief Col. Edgard Arevalo in a statement.</p>
<p>In fact, Duterte himself said as much when he made the same accusations about the Lumad schools <a href="http://pcoo.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/20170724-MEDIA-INTERVIEW-WITH-PRESIDENT-RODRIGO-ROA-DUTERTE-FOLLOWING-HIS-2ND-STATE-OF-THE-NATION-ADDRESS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during a press conference </a>immediately after his second State of the Nation Address (SONA) on July 24, saying that the schools were teaching Lumad children “subversion, communism, everything” and “to rebel against the government.”</p>
<p>Duterte’s claims against Lumad schools, however, were denied by the <a href="https://www.ndfp.org/declaration-75-npa-lumad-big-lie-deceitful/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP),</a> calling them “a big lie, deceitful and provokes further attacks against the Lumad peoples.” The NDFP is an umbrella organization that counts the CPP and the NPA among its members.</p>
<p>The SOS Network also refuted Duterte’s claims, saying that the Lumad schools have the necessary government permits to operate and that the 221 schools that serve over 8,000 indigenous children have long been “partners of the Department of Education’s Indigenous People’s Education Program (IPED) that aims to combat illiteracy in the Indigenous communities.”</p>
<p>Even the DepEd has belied Duterte’s statement, with a spokesperson stating that “there are no existing Lumad schools that are illegally operating” and that all Lumad schools were duly registered.</p>
<figure id="attachment_99350" style="width: 3000px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/03/"><img class="size-full wp-image-99350" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/03.jpg" alt="" width="3000" height="2000" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/03.jpg 3000w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/03-548x365.jpg 548w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/03-840x560.jpg 840w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/03-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Dumagat leader Kakay Tolentino of BAI calls for an end to miliatrization and attacks on their schools and scommunitties (Photo by Mark Ambay III/Lente)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Even more alarming are Duterte’s threats to bomb Lumad schools and communities. The militarization of Lumad communities has been going on for decades, mostly covertly and has been denied by the government and by military officials while government forces have largely escaped punishment for abuses. Duterte’s pronouncement, however, is the first time a Philippine president publicly threatened to bomb indigenous schools and communities.</p>
<p>“Leave. I&#8217;m telling those in the Lumad schools now, get out. I&#8217;ll bomb you. I&#8217;ll include your structures,” announced Duterte in Filipino during a press conference.</p>
<p>The statement has caused outrage among human rights activists and other cause-oriented groups in the country and elsewhere, with advocacy group <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/07/25/philippine-presidents-appalling-threat-bomb-tribal-schools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Human Rights Watch declaring that</a> “by calling for an attack on schools, Duterte is directing the military to commit war crimes. International humanitarian law – the laws of war – prohibits attacks on schools and other civilian structures unless they are being used for military purposes. Deliberately attacking civilians, including students and teachers, is also a war crime.”</p>
<p><a href="https://sandugo.org/statements/is-the-president-driving-us-to-the-rebe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“If the schools were destroyed, so is our future,”</a> lamented Jerome Succor Aba, co-chairperson of Sandugo, a nationwide alliance of national minorities, adding that Duterte’s statement means that he wants “to destroy our race.”</p>
<p><a href="https://saveourschoolsnetwork.wordpress.com/2017/07/28/save-our-schools-network-unity-statement-on-president-dutertes-threat-to-bomb-lumad-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOS strongly condemned Duterte,</a> saying that his declaration will be considered as “a marching order by his lapdogs in the AFP, continuing and intensifying attacks on Lumad schools, communities and projects.”</p>
<p><strong>Resistance</strong></p>
<p>During Duterte’s second SONA, almost 200 Lumad, including <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2017/07/20/lumad-leaders-students-join-sona-protest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some 50 students of Alcadev and other Lumad schools,</a> joined the protest march to condemn the continued militarization of indigenous communities and attacks on Lumad schools.</p>
<p>“We came here to demand justice,” said Dulphing Ogan, secretary-general of the Mindanao-wide Lumad alliance Kalumaran.</p>
<p>“It looks like he has forgotten his promise to help us. We are here to remind him,” Ogan added.</p>
<p>It seems Duterte has indeed forgotten, given his pronouncement regarding the bombing of Lumad schools. In fact, the government has canceled peace negotiations with the NDFP, which would have recognized the right to self-determination of indigenous peoples, as well as their right to establish their own schools.</p>
<p>On Aug. 31 this year, 2,600 people from national minority groups arrived in Manila in what has become a yearly event dubbed the Lakbayan. This year’s series of activities focuses on demands that the government lift martial law that was <a href="http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2017/05/23/proclamation-no-216-s-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared in Mindanao on May 23.</a> Duterte made the declaration after the terrorist group Dawlah Islamiya led by the Maute brothers launched an attack on the Moro-dominated Islamic city of Marawi in Mindanao.</p>
<p>The declaration, however, has been met with resistance by indigenous and human rights groups.</p>
<p>“Martial law will just give the military and the paramilitary groups under them a stronger license to pillage indigenous and Moro communities,” said Piya Malayao of Katribu, an alliance of indigenous peoples groups in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Even the children who study in Lumad schools are against the declaration.</p>
<p>“It’s not the NPA or the Maute group that’s getting bombed, it’s civilians,” said Dimlester Dumanglay, who is 13 and one of the Indigenous children studying in a Lumad school, in an interview with the major Philippine daily. He was referring to the bombings in Marawi that the government has launched in order to flush the Maute fighters out of the city.</p>
<p>Dumanglay added that red-tagging of Lumad schools has gotten worse under Duterte, especially after martial law was declared.</p>
<p>“They filed complaints against our teachers, accused them of trafficking and child abuse. Those aren’t true. Those complaints shouldn’t be continued, because our teachers only teach us the truth, how to read, write, and count,” he lamented.</p>
<p>Though <a href="http://pcoo.gov.ph/news_releases/presidential-spokesperson-ernie-abella-prrds-remarks-lumad-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the presidential spokesperson</a> has since clarified Duterte’s statement regarding bombing Lumad schools, and the military has stated that it would not bomb the schools, Duterte himself has remained silent on the issue and has not retracted his statement.</p>
<p>With martial law still in effect in Mindanao, Michael Fay, a community educator from CLANS, predicts that things will get worse and that with the continuation of martial law “there will be more school closures.”</p>
<p>Aba believes that the possible closure of more Lumad schools can and will have negative effects on the Lumad and other national minorities and that the future of their people is on the line. &#8220;Duterte’s policies and the human rights violations being experienced by the Lumad and other national minorities is adding fuel to the oppression that the Lumad have experienced for years.&#8221;</p>
<p>And with that, Aba believes there is only one course the national minorities will take.</p>
<p>“We are left with no choice but to resist.” <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p>The bloody trail of killings of activists continues under President Duterte.</p>
<p><strong>By KAREN ANN MACALALAD</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA &#8212; Despite the warm, popular support from the masses at the start of his term, President Rodrigo Duterte has chosen the path where the poor are killed and further pushed to the margins. Aside from those killed in anti-drug operations, which the Philippine National Police puts at under 4,000, cases of human rights violations continue to surge by the day, with every place made vulnerable to attacks and political violence.</p>
<p>By the first month of Duterte’s second year in office, reported cases of politically-motivated extrajudicial killings are up by 10 from the 68 recorded as of June 30. Seventy-six out of a total of 78 victims are from the peasant sector, 22 of whom come from the national minorities, data from human rights group Karapatan showed.</p>
<p>The Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (KMP) strongly condemned the killings and attributed these attacks to the worsening state of land problem in the country. Instead of pursuing his promise to support genuine land reform, Duterte allowed the killings, militarization of communities and implementation of martial law in Min-danao under his first year in office, KMP Chairman Danilo Ramos said.</p>
<p><strong>Killing fields</strong></p>
<p>On July 25, the day Duterte delivered his second State of the Nation Address, fisherfolk leader Alberto Tecson was killed by six suspected state forces at 10 p.m., in his house in Bulado village, Guihulngan City, Negros Oriental. Forty-five-year old Tecson was the chair of the Guihulngan chapter of fisherfolk group Pamalakaya, who led the campaign against the strict fishing rules and exorbitant fees imposed on small fisherfolk under the Amended Fisheries Code or Republic Act 10654.</p>
<p>His wife said members of the 79th Infantry Battalion (IB) accused Tecson of transporting armed groups using his pump boat a day before the shooting incident happened. On July 24, the military returned to their commu-nity while residents were at a rally.</p>
<p>A similar case also happened in Maragusan, Compostela Valley where peasant activist Boy Cañete was shot dead by soldiers allegedly under the 71st and 46th infantry battalion, at around 6 p.m. of July 21. Cañete was an active advocate of the peasant’s struggle for genuine land reform, according to Karapatan-Southern Min-danao Region (Karapatan-SMR).</p>
<p>&#8220;We strongly condemn this latest incident of political killing in the region perpetrated by government troops under Duterte&#8217;s desperate extension of martial law. These troops are using the imposition of martial law as a license to execute fascist acts on civilian populace, notably on individuals directly participating in the demo-cratic assertion of the people&#8217;s legitimate demands,&#8221; Jay Apiag of Karapatan-SMR said in a statement.</p>
<p>Tecson and Cañete are only two of the 50 organized victims killed as of July 2017. Based on Karapatan re-ports, more than half of the extrajudicial killings are also from the Mindanao region.</p>
<p>Still in Mindanao, on July 6, in Cabanglasan, Bukidnon, members of the paramilitary group Alamara shot dead Ande Latuan, a member of the Lumad group Pigyayungaan. Latuan was aboard his motorcycle along with Lumad woman Alang Kaligunan when they were blocked by five Alamara men at the Cabanglasan town proper. One of the Alamara, Mako Santos fired two shots at Latuan, who instantly died. The paramilitary men threatened to also kill Kaligunan if she tells anyone. The group Pigyayungaan has strongly advocated the protection of Lumad ancestral lands and government use of paramilitary men as investment defense forces.</p>

<p>“The cases happen nationwide, notably in provinces and areas where there are land problems, agribusiness firms and ongoing struggle of farmers for land and justice,” Ramos said. Over the past year, farmers continue to experience poverty and extreme hunger due to the existence of the hacienda system under the Duterte ad-ministration, he said.</p>
<p>Some of the disputed haciendas in Luzon, for example, include the 6,453-hectare Hacienda Luisita in Tarlac, the 8,650-hectare Hacienda Looc in Batangas and 8,000-hectare Hacienda Dolores in Pampanga. In this region, Karapatan documented 20 victims of extrajudicial killings and one enforced disappearance.</p>
<p><strong>Continuing the bloody legacy</strong></p>
<p>Comparing the number of violations and abuses under the first year of Duterte and then President Benigno Aquino III, there is no improvement on the human rights situation in the country. Cases of illegal arrests and militarization of communities which led to the displacement and forcible evacuation of residents are notably high under Duterte.</p>
<p>The imposition and extension of martial law in Mindanao, along with the military’s all-out war, drug war and implementation of the counter-insurgency program Oplan Kapayapaan gave blanket authority to state forces to commit human rights violations with impunity, according to Karapatan.</p>

<p>Latest victims of illegal arrests include <a href="http://karapatan.org/Karapatan+condemns+killing%2C+arrest%2C+harassment+and+forcible+evacuation+of+peasants+in+Bicol%2C+Negros%2C+Quirino+and+Ilocos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">33-year old Aeta farmer Antonio Narvaez of Bicol region,</a> and five members of the Compostela Farmers Association (CFA): Alicia Tindasan, 62; Alexir Mata, 31; Jhona Rose Madrid, 39; Rolando Segovia, 47; and Estanislao Talledo, 50. Narvaez was arrested on July 19 by soldiers of the 83rd IB and 9th Infantry Division as he fetched water for his elderly uncle in Turague village, Sangay, Camarines Sur. The five CFA members arrested by 66th IB soldiers on July 2, and charged with criminal trumped-up cases.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 28 schools have stopped their operations in Mindanao since the declaration of Martial Law in the region, Save Our Schools Network-SMR reported. A total of 924 Lumad students have to stop studying, 864 were forced to evacuate from their communities due to military operations, while one is reported missing after an encounter with soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>Struggle for real change</strong></p>
<p>Progressive groups have called for the lifting of martial law in Mindanao, and resumption of peace talks be-tween the Government of the Philippines and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines. They also call for the release of the 416 political prisoners detained, 57 of whom were arrested under Duterte.</p>
<p>“We remind Duterte that counterinsurgency programs have not worked, nor did the bombings and all other militarist approaches. The key is in solving the socioeconomic and political ills of our country,&#8221; Karapatan Secretary-general Cristina Palabay said in a statement.</p>
<p>Peaceful resolution of the armed conflict may now be an abandoned option to Duterte, as he announced after his SONA last month that his administration will no longer pursue talks between government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP).</p>
<p>The peace negotiations were set to tackle the Comprehensive Agreement on Socio-Economic Reforms (CASER), a definite progress from what was reached under previous administrations, Ramos said. “The major points in CASER, which involve free distribution of land and rural development, have long been campaigned for by the peasant movement in the country.”</p>
<p>The KMP also called for the confirmation of Rafael Mariano as the Department of Agrarian Reform secretary and passage of the Genuine Agrarian Reform Bill. “It is the first time we have a DAR secretary that came from the peasant sector and movement. In our years of experience, the appointed officers under the DAR were mostly anti-farmers and brokers,” Ramos claimed.</p>
<p>“Stop killing peasants who feed the nation. The peasant sector which produces the food should be prioritized and valued by the government.” Ramos said.<br />

<p>Thirty years under a sham agrarian reform program and one year under a progressive agrarian reform chief.</p>
<p><strong>By DANIEL BOONE</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat</a></em></p>
<p>There are at least two ironies concerning land reform. The first one is the fact that the Philippines remain to be among the top importers of rice despite being an agricultural country with the majority of its population being farmers. The second and more obvious is the fact that farmers remain to be the poorest among all sectors despite working tirelessly day-in, night-out, to put food on every Filipino table.</p>
<p>It is hard to just accept that the world is full of contradictions, especially when these have hindered the development of the country itself. And partly &#8212; if not fully—to blame is poor implementation of agrarian reform program in the country. For the longest time, the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) has failed to do its primary job of distributing lands to farmers.</p>
<p>This is why hopes were high when President Rodrigo Duterte appointed Rafael “Ka Paeng” Mariano as the secretary of the department. Former chairperson of peasant group Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas (KMP) and representative of peasant partylist Anakpawis in Congress, Mariano is the first legitimate farmer to assume the position as DAR chief. He is one with the hundreds of farmers who joined the 40,000-strong protest parallel to Duterte’s second State of the Nation Address.</p>
<p><strong>Former peasant leader Mariano in DAR</strong></p>
<p>The first thing Mariano did after taking his oath in the position was to remove the metal gates that surround DAR office. But apart from welcoming the farmers to the Agrarian Reform office, Mariano did spearhead distribution of lands and dismantling of haciendas across the archipelago. It started in his first months in office when he sped up land distribution in Hacienda Luisita in Tarlac, with at least 370 hectares of land was declared ready for acquisition.</p>
<figure id="attachment_97182" style="width: 960px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/du30-ka-paeng-mendio-kampuhan-may9-by-kilab/"><img class="size-full wp-image-97182" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/du30-ka-paeng-mendio-kampuhan-may9-by-kilab.jpg" alt="FILE PHOTO: President Duterte (seated) speaks to Marbai and other farmer leaders, with DAR Secretary Rafael &quot;Ka Paeng&quot; Mariano (seated, right) inside the protest camp in Mendiola.

<p>Mariano also campaigned for a two-year moratorium on land use conversion, which hinders conversion of agricultural lands to other use, like commercial or residential. Provisions on the currently implemented Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) and its extension with reforms (CARPER) allow farmlands to be converted, and it has been used undeterred by landlords to retain ownership of the lands, said KMP Secretary General Antonio Flores.</p>
<p>The department order for the moratorium has been pending since last year in the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC), the highest policy-making and coordinating body for agrarian reform programs.</p>
<p>But as former mass leader, Mariano has united DAR with the farmers to collectively push for the institutionalization and passage of House Bill (HB) 555, otherwise known as the Genuine Agrarian Reform Bill (GARB). Progressive peasants believe GARB will -put an end to CARP and CARPER and truly distribute the lands to its tillers. The bill was first filed in the landlord-dominate Congress in 2008 by the late labor leader Crispin “Ka Bel” Beltran.</p>
<p><strong>Three decades of bogus land reform program</strong></p>
<p>Peasant groups like KMP and Unyon ng Manggagawa sa Agrikultura (UMA) have long declared CARP a failure.</p>
<p>An estimated 7.8 million hectares of land were to be distributed under CARP from 1988 up to 1998, but a law amending and re-channeling additional funds for the program extended the deadline for another 10 years. Come 2008, however, lands are still not fully distributed, which paved the way for another extension with reforms, also known as CARPER.</p>
<p>While more than 6.9 million hectares or 88 percent of all CARP-able lands have already been said to be distributed to farmers, a whopping 44 percent of this are public lands, according to findings of KMP. Meaning, farmers will pay amortization fees for using lands that have been public all the while.</p>
<p>But the bureaucracy that slows down the process of land distribution is just one of the many problems that haunt CARP and its implementation. Certificate of Land Ownership Awards (CLOAs), which are given to farmers who receive parcels of their land, are getting cancelled because of loopholes in CARP, Flores said. DAR is still investigating the issue and is soon to publish data regarding farmers with CLOAs cancelled.</p>
<p>The exacerbating conditions of farmers under CARP have forced farmers to mobilize, which government responded to with violence. Human rights violations against and killings of peasants and farmworkers have been rampant and, in fact, drastically increased under Duterte, reaching its peak in March with almost one farmer getting killed every two days, according to KMP data.</p>
<p>But Mariano as DAR chief continues to gain support from the farmers’ sector, especially that DAR has forged unity with peasant groups to push for a genuine land reform through GARB.</p>
<p><strong>Unity among peasant groups and DAR</strong></p>
<p>On his first year report State of Agrarian Reform Address held on July 20, Mariano stressed that while he remains in DAR, he will continue strengthening the campaigns to fully distribute lands among its tillers and dismantle haciendas and land monopoly in the country.</p>
<p>“Kami naman po sa DAR ay kaisa ng sambayanang Pilipino [sa laban] … Bilang kalihim ng DAR, nanatili at naniniwala [ako] na ang pangunahin pa ring mapanghahawakan, masasandigan na dedepensa sa karapatan ng mga magsasaka ay ‘yung mahigpit na pagkakaisa at organisadong lakas ng magsasaka (We in DAR are one with the struggles of the Filipino people … As DAR Secretary, I stand firm and believe that we could always rely on our collective action and organized movement in defending our rights),” Mariano said.</p>
<p>Farmers group have welcomed the statement of support coming from no less than the Agrarian Reform Secretary. Any support from the administration should reinforce the campaigns to later fully realize farmers tilling their own lands, said Flores, who reiterated that Mariano also accepts the challenges posed by farmers groups for him to accomplish within next year.</p>
<p>Aside from strengthening campaigns for institutionalizing GARB, the farmers also demanded Mariano to put an end to land-use conversion and return the coco levy funds or the taxes which have been collected from coconut farmers during Marcos’s Martial Law. The total coco levy fund is pegged to be around P75 billion, and concerns more than three million coconut farmers, whose products remain to be the country’s top agricultural export.</p>
<p>DAR is reaching new heights with their recent achievements in terms of helping peasants, according to assessments of farmers groups. But Mariano in DAR alone could not possibly turn around a long-running system, said Flores.</p>
<p>“Si Ka Paeng, kung nag-iisa siya sa DAR, hindi niya kakayanin, dahil may mga batas na nagiging hadlang sa kanya. Kailangan pa rin ng push mula sa hanay natin (Ka Paeng cannot handle it alone in DAR, and there are laws hindering him. We need to give a push from our ranks),” Flores added.<br />

<p>“I hope she is still alive.”</p>
<p><strong>By DANIEL BOONE</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat</a></em></p>
<p>It was 2 a.m., the dead of the night, when military men forcibly entered a farmer’s home in Hagonoy, Bulacan. “Do not be afraid,” they said. “We will not hurt you.” But they lied.</p>
<p>They grabbed the residents by the back of their heads, pointed their guns, and accused them of being rebels.</p>
<p>By the end of the hour, the soldiers were gone, but so were the three guests of the house: farmer Manuel Merino, Karen Empeño and Sherlyn Cadapan, the latter two are students from the University of the Philippines (UP) conducting a study in the farmers’ community.</p>
<p>This was the sworn statement of Wilfredo Ramos, an eyewitness to the abduction and whose revelations have been very crucial to the court case filed by the families of Karen and Sherlyn against the military. The three victims have been missing for the past 11 years.</p>
<p>Ramos was only 14 during that time. He is 25 now, with two children, yet Karen and Sherlyn are still missing, and the case filed by their families in court moves at a snail’s pace. Justice in this country again proves to be elusive.</p>
<p><strong>Delaying tactics</strong></p>
<p>A number of UP students have kept the annual tradition to remember Karen and Sherlyn on the day of their disappearance every June 26, and they did so again this year, with a candle-lighting activity at the Dap-ayan, College of Mass Communications.</p>
<p>The identified “mastermind” of the disappearance, retired Major General Jovito Palparan is charged with kidnapping and serious illegal detention. He has been detained for three years, his two other co-accused military officials even longer. Still the families of the victims’ decry the delayed justice due to the frequent postponement of hearings.</p>
<p>The last hearing was scheduled on June 1 at the Bulacan Regional Trial Court in Malolos. It was rescheduled, however, because Palparan failed to attend, said <em>Nanay</em> Connie Empeño, Karen’s mother. Before that, several other hearings were also postponed due to different reasons.</p>
<p><em>“Wala ang abogado, inoperahan sa appendicitis; wala ang abogado, may LBM … mga ganoong dahilan na teknik lang nila para ma-delay</em> (The lawyer was purportedly absent because of a surgery for appendicitis; they do not have a lawyer because of LBM [loose bowel movement] … reasons like these are just their delaying tactics),” said <em>Nanay</em> Linda Cadapan, Sherlyn’s mother.</p>
<p>For the past 11 years, the two mothers in search for their missing daughters have been called “Nanay,” or mother, by many, especially UP students.</p>
<p>Nanay Linda said they have heard all sorts of alibi, especially the one repeatedly used by the camp of Palparan: their witness could not come.</p>
<p>Since Palparan’s trial started, the military has listed a total of 10 witnesses, Nanay Connie said, but none of them have been presented. Palparan’s camp even tried to get Ramos to refute his previous sworn statement, but they were unsuccessful, said Nanay Linda.</p>
<p>But justice will remain as abstract as it is so long as Palparan and his co-accused gets unlimited second chances from the court. And while justice is being delayed and denied, Karen and Sherlyn’s family are forced to deal with despair. Nanay Connie and Nanay Linda’s stories of struggle paint a gloomy picture, which becomes even more depressing when looked from afar and from a larger scale. That is, Karen and Sherlyn are only two of the many who were victims of enforced disappearances.</p>
<p><strong>Enforced disappearance: worst form of human rights violations</strong></p>
<p>They are called “desaparecidos,” a Spanish term which translates to “the disappeared” — a term so appropriate for the likes of Karen and Sherlyn, who have gone missing.</p>
<p>International human rights groups acknowledge enforced disappearances as the “worst kind of<br />
human rights violation,” as it victimizes both the disappeared and their loved ones who are left inside a vacuum of emotions, not knowing what to feel: primarily, fear for what happened, then anxiety and worry about the fate of the victim, but also hope, for not having a dead body presented at them.</p>
<p><em>“Kahit ga-hibla na lang ng sinulid ang pag-asa, kakapitan ko. Pag-asa pa rin ‘yun na mahahanap namin si Sherlyn, at mayayakap ko siya</em> (Even hope as thin as thread, I will cling to. That is still hope that we will find Sherlyn, and I can embrace her),” said Nanay Linda.</p>

<p>Since 2001, there have been a total of 236 documented cases of enforced disappearances in the country. Of which, 206 were during the nine-year term of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.</p>
<p>With 1,206 victims of summary executions and 2,059 of illegal arrests under his reign as military chief, Palparan has well-earned the nickname “The Butcher.” These inhumane acts ideally mean no forgiveness from the law, but Palparan actually gets special treatment in his detention cell.</p>
<p><em>“Nasa Fort Bonifacio siya, andun ‘yung mga militar niya. Tapos kapag hearing, ang daming sundalo ang kasama niya</em> (He is in Fort Bonifacio with his old subordinates. During hearings, he is accompanied by many soldiers),” Nanay Connie said. However, despite seemingly lopsided, Nanay Connie and Nanay Linda believe that soon, justice will be served for Karen, Sherlyn, and other desaparecidos.</p>
<p><strong>A plea for justice</strong></p>
<p>Eleven years since Karen and Sherlyn were abducted, their families miss them and wait for their return.</p>
<p>“Ubos na ang luha ko, pero naghihintay at naghahanap pa rin … Ayaw ko ng sa kabilang mundo kami magtatagpo [ni Sherlyn] (I’ve run out of tears, but I still wait and search … I don’t want to meet Sherlyn in the other world),” said Nanay Linda, appealing to the government for any help they could give.</p>
<p>“Sana [makatulong ang gobyerno na] maipalabas na [si Karen] at mabigyan ng agarang hustisya … pero umaasa pa rin akong buhay siya (I hope the government could help surface Karen and justice be served urgently … but I still hope she is alive),” Nanay Connie plead.</p>
<p>The next court hearing is scheduled on July 17, and the mothers hope it will be the last hearing that they will attend. Every hearing entails meeting the perpetrators to their daughters&#8217; disappearance and reliving every memory since they were taken away. One can only imagine the intensity of the pain Nanay Connie and Nanay Linda feel, topped with physical fatigue and dwindling resources to go to court.</p>
<p>This court decision is a crucial part of moving on, said Nanay Linda. But they cannot more forward so long as the accused continues to play with the legal process.</p>
<p><em>“Sana hindi na ma-delay. Sana magkaroon na ng decision na faultless</em> (I wish it would not be delayed. I wish a decision that is faultless come soon),” said Nanay Connie. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

Almost coinciding with the two-year anniversary of Kentex factory fire was the 100th day since the HTI factory fire in Cavite.</p>
<p><strong>By MARYA SALAMAT</strong></p>
<p>MANILA – Two years ago today, the Kentex factory fire left more than 72 families grieving for their abruptly lost loved ones. They were trapped and charred in the factory building that not only had no fire exit, but also had steel grilles in every window supposedly to discourage the low-paid workers to pilfer any pair of rubber slippers from the company. Majority of Kentex workers were women working under various setups of non-regular employment, including high school graduates seeking to save money for further schooling.</p>
<p>During the mass and program held at the gates of the burnt factory on Saturday, May 13, the survivors and supporters denounced the absence of justice for the fire victims, their families and survivors up to now. “The owners of the slippers factory continue to escape prosecution and accountability,” said the workplace safety NGO Institute for Occupational Health and Safety Development (IOHSAD) in a statement.</p>
<p>Two years after the incident, civil court cases are still ongoing, said Ammied Rada, President of Justice for Workers Alliance and Area Coordinator of Kilos na Manggagawa. Rada was a contractual worker in Kentex at the time of the fire.</p>
<p>At the gathering, Nadia De Leon, IOHSAD advocacy officer, concluded that the country still has not learned from the Kentex factory fire, because less than two years after Kentex, evidences continue to mount that “worse, unsafe and precarious working conditions are still prevalent in sweatshops all over the country.”</p>
<p>In fact, almost coinciding with the two-year anniversary of Kentex factory fire was the 100th day since the HTI factory fire in Cavite. On the 100th day of HTI factory fire, the Task Force Justice to HTI workers conducted a day-long activity in the communities surrounding the HTI and in front also of the Cavite Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA).</p>
<p>HTI or Housing Technology Industries is the biggest factory and employer in the Cavite Export Processing Zone. It burned more than 48 hours on February 2 this year. Until today, doubts persist over the official report by the company and the Cavite local government about the number of fire victims.</p>
<p>Rev. Eric Baldonado of Task Force Justice to HTI Workers said, in Filipino, during their program in front of Cavite PEZA, “There is a need to end this enforced silence due to threats and the seeming coverup of the truth. There is a need for a thorough probe without the intervention of the Cavite local government, Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) or the HTI.” </p>
<p>Many HTI workers hailed from other provinces; it had workers from as far as Lanao del Norte. Baldonado said there is a strong possibility the relatives of the missing do not know yet about what happened to them.</p>
<p>Majority of its workers at the time of the fire in February 2 were also contractuals or agency-hired “regular” workers. Hundreds were feared dead. But because the export processing zone was closed to the public and the media during and immediately after the fire, there were only the accounts of witnesses that due to lack of fire exits, the survivors were forced to jump from the upper floors, and crawl over unconscious bodies of believed to be dead workers at the second floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Violations will be commonplace as long as business interests are valued over the lives of workers,&#8221; said Rada. He explained that this is why on top of seeking justice for the fire victims, survivors and their families, they are campaigning also for the prohibition of all forms of contractualization.</p>
<p>“Like the Kentex workers who died in the factory fire, contractuals are the most vulnerable to violations,” Rada said.</p>
<p>Workers with insecure tenure on the job, even if they have worked for years under the same employers, face a lot of hindrances in forming unions.  They can&#8217;t easily voice complaints and concerns such as the lack of occupational health and safety guarantees. These are the conclusions of workers’ groups in Kentex, in HTI, in Tanduay Distillers and in many other companies with more contractual workers than regular workers.</p>
<p>“Strong unions are the workers&#8217; ultimate defense against all kinds of workplace hazards such as unsafe working conditions, irregular work and low wages. Through their unions, workers can fight for safer working conditions being denied by capitalists,” said De Leon of IOHSAD.</p>
<p><strong>Seeking to criminalize violation of health and safety</strong></p>
<p>In the furor over Kentex factory fire, IOHSAD said the struggle of the workers and their families were crucial in the passage of House Bill 64 in Congress last December 2016. However, its counterpart in the Senate still is yet to be passed. Senate Bill 1317, or the Occupational Health and Safety Standards Act was filed last February a few weeks after the HTI factory.</p>
<p>The consolidated bill on occupational health and safety (OHS) disallows self-assessment as a form of labor standards inspection and imposes stiffer penalties and longer periods of imprisonment for violators of workplace safety and health.</p>
<p>The Senate has included the OSH bill in its priority list, bolstering hope among factory fire survivors and labor advocates that it would be passed and signed into law soon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Task Force Justice to HTI workers is set to file a petition for Congress inquiry at the House of Representatives on May 18. Baldonado hopes the country’s representatives would welcome the push for investigation into the HTI fire and a review of laws such as the Special Economic Zone Act of 1994, which, they said, authorized the PEZA to craft policies and regulations inimical to Filipino workers. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>
