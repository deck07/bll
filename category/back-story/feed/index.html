				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eduardo Serrano spent the best years of his life serving the peasantry.  A graduate of University of the Philippines – Los Baños, he could have chosen a life of luxury by working in multinational corporations engaged in Agro-Industry, but he did not. He chose to serve the poorest sectors in Philippine society. </p>
<p>No matter what the military and the government say about him; no matter if one believes or not in the principles he has consistently fought for.  One thing is clear:  he had lived an honorable, principled and selfless life. He does not deserve to die while in detention.</p>
<p>To honor the man and his principles and to rage against the injustices that he has been a victim of, Bulatlat.com is reposting the articles we published about Eduardo Serrano.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bulatlat.com/news/4-15/4-15-redleader.html"><strong>Missing alleged red Leader surfaces in Mindoro police jail</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2016/01/09/ka-eddik/es-upon-arrest-pix/" rel="attachment wp-att-88022"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/es-upon-arrest-pix.jpg" alt="es-upon arrest-pix" width="669" height="340" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-88022" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/es-upon-arrest-pix.jpg 669w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/es-upon-arrest-pix-660x335.jpg 660w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" /></a></p>
<p>“<em>Sandali lang, parang naiiyak ako</em>” (Just a second, I feel like crying). Those were the first words human rights workers heard from Eduardo Serrano, alleged NPA leader from the Southern Tagalog region, nine days after he was held incommunicado by his military captors. After days of searching for him at various jails in Manila  and Southern Tagalog, they finally tracked him at the Calapan City Jail in the island of Mindoro.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2008/04/07/the-political-prisoner-who-never-stopped-learning/"><strong>The political prisoner who never stopped learning</strong></a></p>
<p>He was as upbeat as a teenager when his childhood friend, George, showed up at the Philippine National Police (PNP) Custodial Center in Camp Crame. Wearing black shorts, leather sandals and his customary orange shirt with the words “Free All Political Prisoners,” Eduardo Serrano jumped up and down and hugged his friend whom he had not seen since 1995.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of the usual kumustahan (greetings), Serrano started to update his friend on what had led him behind bars, from his arrest on May 2, 2004 at the Batangas pier after coming from a consultation with Fidel Agcaoili, member of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) Peace Negotiating Panel and co-chairperson of the Joint Monitoring Committee (JMC) for the Comprehensive Agreement on Respect for Human Rights &#038; International Humanitarian Law (CARHRIHL) who was visiting the country then. Serrano is a consultant of the NDFP from the province of Mindoro Oriental, an island south of Manila.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2014/05/14/ndfp-consultant-has-spent-a-decade-in-prison/"><strong>NDFP consultant has spent a decade in prison</strong></a></p>
<p>For ten years, Eduardo Serrano has been languishing in jail for crimes he did not commit.</p>
<p>Serrano, a consultant of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) in Southern Tagalog, was arrested on May 2, 2004 at the Batangas pier.</p>
<p>Serrano has been slapped with five charges: three charges of multiple murder, one kidnapping and one attempted homicide. Of the five, only one has been dismissed and the four others are still in court. He spent three years at the Calapan City Jail in Mindoro Oriental before he was transferred to the Philippine National Police Custodial Center at Camp Crame in Quezon City.</p>
<p>“The military presented several witnesses; all of them claimed that I am a high-ranking leader of the communist movement. But the charges filed against me are common crimes, not rebellion,” Serrano said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2016/01/09/ka-eddik/es-that-is-a-lie-pix/" rel="attachment wp-att-88031"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/es-that-is-a-lie-pix.jpg" alt="es-that is a lie-pix" width="640" height="326" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-88031" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/06/26/ndfp-consultant-denies-claims-by-pro-witness/"><strong><br />
NDFP consultant denies claims by ‘pro’ witness</strong></a></p>
<p>A peace consultant of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) denied allegations that he is a ranking official of the underground movement – an allegation made four years ago by a “professional military witness.”</p>
<p>“That is a lie,” peace consultant Eduardo Serrano said during his cross-examination at the hearing of the multiple murder and frustrated murder charges against him at the Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 100 last June 25.</p>
<p>Serrano is the longest detained NDFP consultant who has been languishing in jail since 2004.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/10/22/qc-court-orders-release-of-ndf-peace-consultant-imprisoned-for-11-years/"><strong>QC court orders release of NDF peace consultant imprisoned for 11 years</strong></a></p>
<p>After 11 years in detention, a Quezon City court ordered the immediate release of Eduardo Serrano, a peace consultant of the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP), calling his incarceration “an outright mockery” of the Constitution.</p>
<p>In a court order issued today, Oct. 22, Judge Marilou Runes-Tamang of Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 98, ruled that political prisoner Serrano is not the accused Rogelio Villanueva, whom the military claims is a ranking official of the Communist Party of the Philippines.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/12/01/qc-court-junks-another-case-vs-longest-detained-ndfp-consultant/"><strong>QC court junks another case vs longest-detained NDFP consultant</strong></a></p>
<p>The country’s longest detained political prisoner is calling on all fair-minded judges and rights advocates to continue working and fighting for the respect of human rights and freedom for many political prisoners following the dismissal of another trumped-up case against him.</p>
<p>On Nov. 26, the Quezon City Regional Trial Court Branch 100 acquitted National Democratic Front of the Philippines peace consultant Eduardo Serrano of multiple murder and frustrated murder charges for the prosecution’s failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. This is the second case against him that was dismissed.</p>
<p>In a statement sent to <em>Bulatlat.com</em>, Serrano said he is very much relieved of the developments.</p>
<p>“In my case, I have already suffered 11 years of unjust and cruel detention as a political prisoner, and still continue to suffer such, given the efforts of the reactionary state forces to suppress progressive advocates of and fighters for the cause of the poor and oppressed and the mass of the people in our country,” Serrano said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2016/01/09/ka-eddik/es-by-nato-quote/" rel="attachment wp-att-88033"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/es-by-nato-quote.jpg" alt="es-by nato quote" width="647" height="232" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-88033" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2016/01/08/ailing-ndfp-peace-consultant-passes-away/"><strong>Ailing NDFP peace consultant passes away</strong></a></p>
<p>National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) peace consultant Eduardo Serrano passed away in a hospital this morning, as calls for his release on humanitarian grounds remain unheeded by government. He was 62.</p>
<p>In a Facebook post, Dr. Geneve Rivera-Reyes of the Health Alliance for Democracy, said Serrano passed away at 8:10 a.m.</p>
<p>Since Dec. 16, Serrano had been confined at Philippine Heart Center where he was rushed after suffering a heart attack.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/?p=88035"><strong>‘Aquino, not cardiac arrest killed ailing NDFP consultant’</strong></a></p>
<p>For activists and many progressive, it is not cardiac arrest that killed National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) peace consultant Eduardo Serrano, but the Aquino administration that refused to release him. </p>
<p>“It is not heart attack that killed Ka Eddik, but the ruling few, who, in their despair and insanity, denied him his freedom, believing that this would put an end to the struggle of the people,” Doris Cuario of Karapatan-Southern Tagalog said. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/06/26/ndfp-consultant-denies-claims-by-pro-witness/">Serrano, or Eddik to his family and friends, was an agriculture graduate of the University of the Philippines-Los Baños</a>. He received a post-graduate study on animal science in Copenhagen from 1978 to 1979. When he returned to the country, he helped found the Southern Tagalog-based peasant group Katipunan ng Samahang Magbubukid sa Timog Katagalugan (Kasama-TK), and offered consultancy on farming and irrigation for people’s organizations  and private individuals. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/12/06/under-aquino-political-dissent-is-a-crime/"><strong>Under Aquino, political dissent is a crime</strong></a></p>
<p>President Benigno Aquino III, the son of so-called icons of democracy, criminalizes the exercise of civil and political rights.</p>
<p>Since Aquino assumed the presidency, 304 activists were arrested and detained, bringing the number of political prisoners to 561.</p>
<p>According to human rights group Karapatan, 85 percent of political prisoners were slapped with criminal charges, a clear violation of the Hernandez political doctrine, a Supreme Court jurisprudence that prohibits the criminalization of political dissent.</p>

Now 20 years in effect, the Urban Development and Housing Act is touted to solve housing and urban congestion while protecting the urban poor’s rights and welfare. But since last year it did not bar from happening the most violent demolitions of urban poor communities in history.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Urban Development and Housing Act of 1992 was passed twenty years ago supposedly to solve the problems of housing and urban congestion while protecting the rights and welfare of the urban poor.  It supposedly aims to “uplift the conditions of the underprivileged and homeless citizens in urban areas and in resettlement areas.”  However, last year, the country has witnessed the most violent demolitions of urban poor communities in history.  </p>
<p>What made these possible?  What is in the law that, instead of protecting the rights and welfare of the urban poor, has made them victims of violent demolitions and has made it possible to throw them to far-flung areas with no livelihood opportunities and basic services? Are there flaws and loopholes in the law or is it not being implemented properly?  To help answer these questions during the 20th year of the UDHA, Bulatlat is reposting this article, which we published last year. </p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2011/06/06/urban-development-and-housing-act-merely-meant-to-delay-demolition-of-urban-poor-communities/">Urban Development and Housing Act merely meant to delay demolition of urban poor communities</a></strong></p>
<p>MANILA — For urban poor communities, a threat of a demolition is a threat to their lives and their livelihood. Naturally, they would fight it, by all means possible and whatever is at hand, including picking up rocks, bottles, and, in other circumstances, “t-bombs” (or plastic bags filled with human feces), and fire it to those who dare quell their resistance.</p>
<p>Usually news reports covering demolition of urban poor communities highlight the violent confrontations between the residents and the demolition teams. This normally elicits negative reactions from the public. Were the residents ignorant of the law? Were they too poor to pay for legal services? Or, worse, are they simply uneducated? Why are they fighting for something that is not theirs?</p>
<p>There is a law, actually, that supposedly ensures the welfare of poor families living in communities: Republic Act No. 7279 or the Urban Development and Housing Act (UDHA) of 1992. It was passed to supposedly “uplift the conditions of the underprivileged and homeless citizens in urban areas and in resettlement areas” through the provision of “decent housing at [an] affordable cost, basic services, and employment opportunities. Its program, as stipulated in the law, covers “all lands in urban and urbanizable areas,” which includes existing “priority development sites” and those which the local government identifies as “suitable for socialized housing.”</p>
<p>But urban poor groups and advocates said that for the past 18 years, the UDHA “did not serve the interest of the poor but that of capitalists,” said Bea Arellano of urban poor group Kadamay. Projects like building a Central Business District that drives away the Filipino masses from their homes, she added, would only protect and serve the interest of the few ruling classes.</p>
<p>Arellano added that the UDHA only reiterates the “steps on how to drive away poor families from their homes.” Worse, in a consultation between the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers and urban poor groups, they have confirmed what they have long suspected: there is a big disparity between what is stipulated in the law and what is being implemented on the ground. <strong><em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2011/06/06/urban-development-and-housing-act-merely-meant-to-delay-demolition-of-urban-poor-communities/">(Click here to read more)</a></em></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The watch list order issued by the Department of Justice (DOJ) against former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, the subsequent temporary restraining order (TRO) issued by the Supreme Court, and her eventual hospital arrest generated a lot of legal controversy.  Arroyo, her family, allies and lawyers claim that the issuance of the order was illegal because there had been no case filed against her during the time it was issued.  This assertion was reinforced by the issuance of the TRO by the High Court.  </p>
<p>The Aquino administration and Justice Secretary Leila de Lima said it is within their authority to do so to prevent Arroyo from eluding justice  </p>
<p>Well, clearly the Aquino administration took its sweet time in filing the cases, thus they had to act in haste when Arroyo attempted to leave.  </p>
<p>The legality or illegality of the hold departure order and eventual arrest of Arroyo rest on hairsplitting arguments. But one thing is for sure, Arroyo, her family and allies have a lot to answer for. In the interest of the quest for justice, <em>Bulatlat.com</em> is reposting its article on the crimes of the Arroyo government against the Filipino people.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The debate over the reproductive health bill is heating up with the men of the cloth, the Bishops, threatening to launch a civil disobedience campaign and the men of power, President Aquino and his spokespersons, threatening to file inciting to sedition cases against those who would refuse to pay taxes as part of a civil disobedience campaign.  Even in the Lower House, two men, Rep. Edcel Lagman and Rep. Manny Pacquiao, crossed swords during a plenary session.  It&#8217;s as if it is the men who are affected by the absence or the enactment of a reproductive health bill.  </p>
<p>Absence in the debate is the voice of women who would be greatly affected by the rejection or enactment of a reproductive health bill.  In reality, viewing reproductive health from the perspective only of population control is, as aptly described by Gabriela Women&#8217;s Party Rep.  Luzviminda Ilagan a &#8220;myopic view.&#8221;  As Bulatlat&#8217;s contribution to the debate, we are reposting this article describing Gabriela&#8217;s  reproductive health bill.</p>

Gabriela&#8217;s landmark bill can provide much needed relief to poverty-stricken women and their families by ensuring full access to health services.</strong></p>
<p><strong>By ANNE MARXZE D. UMIL<br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></strong></p>
<p>MANILA &#8212; KJ, 28, a mother of three said she did not avail of the supposedly free health services of the government during her past three pregnancies. During her last pregnancy, she said, she spent $139 in a public lying-in center. “Since it was supposedly free, I thought that I would be able to save money. I had difficulties not only in giving birth but also in raising funds to pay the lying-in center,” KJ said. </p>
<p>“That is why it is important for the <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2010/10/09/dissecting-the-comprehensive-reproductive-health-act/">Comprehensive Reproductive Health (RH) Bill</a> to be passed in Congress for us, women, who have low income. This will enable us to have full access to health services,” KJ said, adding that the reproductive health bill should be “pro-poor and pro-women and not focused only on population control.” </p>

Umil / bulatlat.com)</em></span></div>
<p>It has been 16 years since the first RH Bill was filed in the House of Representatives. But years have passed and an RH bill has never been enacted because of the vehement opposition of the Catholic Church.  </p>
<p>The Comprehensive Reproductive Health Bill was filed during the 15th Congress by the Gabriela Women’s Party (GWP). GWP Representative Luzviminda Ilagan said the bill was filed with the awareness that population growth was never the culprit and thus, population control is never a solution to poverty.  </p>
<p>“We are pushing for the enactment of a comprehensive reproductive health law recognizing the social injustice and inequality and the consequent poverty that majority of the Filipino women have to contend with,” the GWP said in a signed statement.  </p>
<p><strong>Salient Points of RH Bill</strong></p>
<p>The GWP’s Comprehensive Reproductive Health Bill and five other bills have been consolidated into <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/49328993/Consolidated-RH-Bill-HB-4244">House Bill 4244</a> or An Act Providing for a National Policy on Responsible Parenthood, Reproductive Health and Population and Development and for other Purposes. </p>
<p>HB 4244 is far from perfect, said the GWP in a statement. “We are pushing for this legislation along with the consciousness that this is not an assurance that women’s right to full access to health care services will be easily given.” However, the GWP said HB 4244 brings to the fore a landmark bill that would help address the alarming increase in maternal deaths, infant deaths and HIV cases. “It is a landmark bill that can potentially bring much needed relief to poverty-stricken women and their families by ensuring full access to reproductive health services.”    </p>
<p>The GWP presented salient points of the HB 4244 lifted from and in agreement with the Comprehensive Reproductive Health Bill:  </p>
<p>Midwives for skilled attendance &#8212; the local government units (LGU) with the assistance of the Department of Health (DOH), shall employ an adequate number of midwives to achieve a minimum ratio of one full-time skilled birth attendant for every 150 deliveries per year.</p>
<p>Emergency obstetric care &#8212; each province and city, with the assistance of the DOH, shall establish or upgrade hospitals with adequate and qualified personnel, equipment and supplies to be able to provide emergency obstetric care.</p>
<p>Access to family planning &#8212; all accredited health facilities shall provide a full range of modern family planning methods, except in specialty hospitals which may render such services on optional basis. For poor patients, such services shall be fully covered by PhilHealth Insurance and/or government financial assistance on a no balance billing.</p>
<p>Maternal and newborn health care in crisis situations &#8212; LGUs and the DOH shall ensure that a Minimum Initial Service Package (MISP) for reproductive health, including maternal and neonatal health care kits and services, as defined by the DOH, will be given proper attention in crisis situations such as disasters and humanitarian crises.</p>
<div style="width: 272px; height: auto; float: left; margin-right: 10px; background: #000000; padding: 5px; margin-bottom: 10px"><img style="width: 270px; border: solid 1px #9A9A9A; margin-bottom: 5px" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/02282011_rh_bill_signature_campaign.jpg"><br /><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #ffffff; line-height: 1.3em"> Gabriela says an alarming number of maternity deaths belong to the marginalized sector. <em>(Photo by Anne Marxze D. Umil / bulatlat.com)</em></span></div>
<p>Maternal death review &#8212; all LGU, national and local government hospitals, and other public health units shall conduct annual maternal death review in accordance with the guidelines set by the DOH.</p>
<p>Roles of local government in family planning programs &#8212; the LGUs shall ensure that poor families receive preferential access to services, commodities and programs for family planning. The role of Population Officers at municipal, city and barangay levels in the family planning effort shall be strengthened. </p>
<p>Benefits for serious and life &#8212; threatening reproductive health conditions – all serious and life threatening reproductive health conditions such as HIV and Aids, breast and reproductive tract cancers, obstetric complications menopausal and post-menopausal related conditions &#8211; shall be given the maximum benefits as provided by PhilHealth programs.</p>
<p>Mobile health care service &#8212; each Congressional district may be provided with at least one Mobile Health Care Service (MHCS) in the form of a van or other means of transportation appropriate to coastal or mountainous areas. The MHCS shall deliver health care goods and services to constituents more particularly to the poor and needy.</p>

<p>  The death on Friday of Lourdes E. Simbulan, a UP journalism professor and one of the country's outstanding journalists, has brought to the fore yet again the issue of road safety, specifically road accidents on major highways caused mostly by bus drivers. While there is no doubt that these reckless drivers should be held criminally liable for their actions, there is also the matter of their working conditions that, for all practical purposes, ensure that accidents like the one that killed Simbulan would occur. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The death on Friday of Lourdes E. Simbulan, a UP journalism professor and one of the country&#8217;s outstanding journalists, has brought to the fore yet again the issue of road safety, specifically road accidents on major highways caused mostly by bus drivers. While there is no doubt that these reckless drivers should be held criminally liable for their actions, there is also the matter of their working conditions that, for all practical purposes, ensure that accidents like the one that killed Simbulan would occur. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s a whole gamut of issues involved, among them the lax regulatory functions of the government (for example, anybody can bribe transportation officials for a driver&#8217;s license, without taking the necessary training and examinations).</p>
<p>But the context that is often missing in the debate about road safety is the role the owners and operators of public utility vehicles play. As these Bulatlat.com stories and special reports clearly illustrate, PUV drivers and conductors are among the most exploited workers. </p>
<p>As one such story points out: &#8220;The public and government officials, among them President Aquino, always blame drivers each time a deadly bus accident happens. What they don’t know — or chose to ignore– is that bus drivers and conductors are working under severe conditions imposed by greedy operators and ignored by government regulators, thus allowing these mishaps to happen in the first place.&#8221;</p>

Truth is, both panels have signed several important documents that should move the process forward. Would the Aquino administration genuinely commit to these earlier agreements?</strong></p>
<p><strong>By RONALYN V. OLEA</strong><br />
<em> <a href="http://www.bulatlat.com/">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<div style="width: 118px; height: 71px; float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 5px;"><img style="width: 118px; height: 71px; border: solid 1px #9A9A9A;" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/grp-ndf.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>MANILA &#8212;  The Government of the Philippines (GPH) and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) have been engaged in peace negotiations for almost 25 years now. It has been a long process that, to many Filipinos, has seemingly achieved so little. After all, the Communist revolution is still raging in the countryside and the government has been trying all sorts of methods to suppress or defeat it.</p>
<p>In fact, much has been achieved in the peace process. The agreements and documents that both panels have signed in the past quarter of a century have been significant.</p>
<p>The GPH, then officially named Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP), began peace talks with the NDFP soon after Corazon Cojuangco-Aquino took office after the first People Power uprising in 1986. As an act of goodwill, Aquino released hundreds of political prisoners, thus paving the way for the negotiations. The talks collapsed, however, after police fired upon protesting farmers on Jan. 22, 1987, in what is now known as the Mendiola Massacre.</p>
<p>Talks resumed in 1992, under the new administration of former general Fidel Ramos, when <strong><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2011/01/30/the-hague-joint-declaration-2/">The Hague Joint Declaration</a></strong> was signed on Sept. 1 that same year. The agreement laid down the framework of the peace talks and the substantive agenda to be taken up.</p>
<p>Both parties agreed that formal peace negotiations between the GPH and the NDFP shall be held to resolve the armed conflict and that the common goal of the negotiations shall be the attainment of a just and lasting peace.</p>
<p>“The holding of peace negotiations must be in accordance with mutually acceptable principles, including national sovereignty, democracy and social justice and no precondition shall be made to negate the inherent character and purpose of the peace negotiations,” the declaration states.</p>
<p>According to The Hague Joint Declaration, the substantive agenda of the formal peace negotiations shall include human rights and international humanitarian law, socio-economic reforms, political and constitutional reforms, end of hostilities and disposition of forces. These agenda should be tackled in that particular order.</p>
<p>Years after the Hague agreement was signed, the NDFP would invoke its provisions again and again, especially since the GPH, according to the front, repeatedly violated the spirit and the letter of the agreement. The NDFP is the umbrella organization of revolutionary groups in the Philippines, among them the Communist Party of the Philippines.</p>
<p>Next to be signed, on June 14, 1994 was the<strong> <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2011/01/30/the-breukelen-joint-statement/">Breukelen Joint Statement</a></strong>. Here, confidence-building and goodwill measures are stated as voluntary undertakings of both parties. The NDFP asserts that political prisoners should not be treated and convicted as common criminals.</p>
<p>In the Breukelen Joint Statement, too, the NDFP endorsed the indemnification of victims of human-rights violations under the Marcos dictatorship and proposed the allocation to the victims of at least 30 percent of whatever money recovered from Marcos’s ill-gotten wealth.</p>
<p>To facilitate the peace negotiations, <strong><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=38804&amp;action=edit">the Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees (Jasig)</a> </strong>was signed by both parties on Feb. 24, 1995.</p>
<p>Under the Jasig, both parties have the inherent right to issue documents of identification to its negotiators, consultants, staffers, security and other personnel. Such documents, it says, shall be duly recognized as safe-conduct passes.</p>
<p>All persons with documents of identification or safe-conduct passes are guaranteed free and unhindered passage in all areas in the Philippines, and in traveling to and from the Philippines in connection with the performance of their duties in the negotiations, the Jasig states further.</p>
<p>Jasig also provides that upon presentation by the duly accredited person to any entity, authority or agent of the party concerned, the document of identification or safe-conduct pass shall be honored and respected and the duly accredited person shall be accorded due recognition and courtesy and allowed free and unhindered passage.</p>
<p>Immunity guarantees shall mean that all duly accredited persons of both parties are guaranteed immunity from surveillance, harassment, search, arrest, detention, prosecution and interrogation or any other similar punitive actions due to any involvement or participation in the peace negotiations.</p>
<p>But since Jasig was signed, the NDFP has been decrying the GPH’s violations. Under the Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo administration, for instance, more than a dozen consultants and members of the NDFP peace panel and reciprocal working committees were arrested or abducted and charged with common crimes.</p>
<p>Recently, Tirso “Ka Bart” Alcantara, a top leader of the New People’s Army in the Southern Tagalog Region, was arrested by state agents. The NDFP has demanded his release, arguing that Alcantara is a holder of document of identification and, thus, covered by Jasig. The government countered by denying that Alcantara is covered by the Jasig and that the NDFP allegedly has the habit of putting in its list of negotiators or consultants arrested NPA leaders.</p>
<p>The NDFP fired back by saying the use of assumed names in documents of identification was agreed upon by both parties in June 1996, in a document titled <strong><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2011/01/30/additional-implementing-rules-pertaining-to-the-documents-of-identification/">Additional Implementing Rules Pertaining to the Documents of Identification.</a> </strong>Presumably, Alcantara is covered by the Jasig under an assumed name or alias.<strong></strong></p>
<p>What followed afterward are <strong><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2011/01/30/joint-agreement-on-the-ground-rules-of-the-formal-meetings-between-the-grp-and-ndfp-panels/">ground rules</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2011/01/30/supplemental-agreement-to-the-joint-agreement-on-the-formation-sequence-and-operationalization-of-the-reciprocal-working-committees-rwc-agreement/">procedural</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2011/01/30/additional-implementing-rules-of-the-joint-agreement-on-safety-and-immunity-guarantees-jasig-pertaining-to-the-security-of-personnel-and-consultations-in-furtherance-of-the-peace-negotiations/">supplemental agreements to Jasig</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2011/01/30/joint-agreement-on-the-formation-sequence-and-operationalization-of-the-reciprocal-working-committees-rwcs/">reciprocal working committees</a></strong> for each substantive agenda item, all signed by both parties between 1995 and 1998.</p>
<p>The first substantive agreement, which many considered a major breakthrough, was the Comprehensive Agreement on Respect for Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law <strong><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2011/01/30/carhrihl/">(CARHRIHL)</a></strong> signed by both parties on March 16, 1998.</p>
