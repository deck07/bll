<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2011/01/21/an-activist-looks-back-on-edsa-2/fringes-logo/" rel="attachment wp-att-38347"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fringes-logo.gif" alt="" width="150" height="151" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38347" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fringes-logo.gif 150w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fringes-logo-90x90.gif 90w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fringes-logo-64x64.gif 64w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>MALOLOS, Bulacan – Having earned a reputation for being both loquacious and boisterous, my relatives, friends, colleagues, and even sources are very much curious on how I manage to keep a straight face whenever I cover issues of human rights violations, especially during hearings against a notorious ‘butcher’ in a courtroom packed with at least a dozen soldiers.</p>
<p>The thing is, I don’t.</p>
<p>There is always room for knowing smiles, snickers, and half-suppressed giggles during these times even when Edith Burgos, the mother of disappeared farmer-activist Jonas Burgos, said she could feel heart up her throat or Concepcion Empeño, mother of disappeared Karen, was profusely sweating because of the tension as we all waited for the promulgation against retired Maj. Gen. Jovito Palparan to start.</p>
<p>Humor, after all, has kept them sane, Mrs. B said. And I can say that it goes for me as well<br />
.<br />
<strong>1. Prayers</strong></p>
<p>As proof of my well-deserved reputation, Mrs. B was just too excited to make me sit next to her – right beside the mothers of the disappeared students – with a look on her face that she is about to tell me a funny story.</p>
<p>“<em>Ito yun Row 4 na nasa Row 1</em>,” I whispered at her son JL Burgos, a filmmaker.</p>
<p>Apparently, before I arrived at the courtroom, the stockiest of the soldiers was bullying those attending the hearing to stop using their mobile phones while they were waiting for the promulgation to begin. He walked around the small courtroom – the burly guy that he is – as if he owned every inch of it.</p>
<p>So what did the witty woman who just turned 75, (Happy birthday!), do? She asserted that they could still use their mobile phones and with a rosary in her hand, she made a cross in the air in the face of the said soldier. Hah.</p>
<p>Many kilometers away from the courtroom, the friends of Mrs. B from the religious community offered their prayers, asking for divine intervention for justice to be served.</p>
<p><strong>2. Revolu-shoe-nary or husti-shoe?</strong></p>
<p>Erlinda Cadapan, mother of disappeared student Sherlyn, had once tried to hit Palparan with her shoe out of frustration and anger. It was, of course, no match to the burly soldiers guarding him. It did not even hit a single strand of his hair. The following hearing, Palparan’s lawyer complained about it before the judge, saying his client was bloodied because of the shoe incident.</p>
<p><em>“Hindi ko nga inabot eh,” </em>Cadapan quipped.</p>
<p>And so during the promulgation, all eyes were on Cadapan and her shoes. The question everyone wanted to pop was: Will she render a “revolu-shoe-nary” justice with a five-inch stiletto?</p>
<p>Surpisingly, Cadapan was wearing flats, which she borrowed from a rather reluctant friend who is most probably worried that she will never get her shoes back.</p>
<p>“I really promised to return it,” she jested.</p>
<p>In the end, Cadapan and the rest of the victims finally achieved the ever elusive “husti-shoe” with Palparan’s conviction.</p>
<p><strong>3. How many years, what?</strong></p>
<p>As the dispositive portion of the 31-page decision was being read, I was personally expecting cheers and woo-hoos from the mothers of the disappeared students, along with human rights workers who were accompanying them. Come on, this is the victory everyone has been waiting for. Instead, there were quiet sobs. They hugged and comforted each other.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Palparan was making a scene and hurling invectives against Judge Alexander Tamayo, whom the retired general called, “g*go” and “duwag” (fool, coward). He continued to do so even when the mothers and their supporters were already heading out of the courtroom.</p>
<p>It was impossible not to be moved to tears. I was trying to blink tears back as I tweeted the guilty verdict when a fellow reporter asked me, “<em>ilang taon daw makukulong si Palparan?</em>” (How many years was the sentence?)</p>
<p>I tried to rake my brain for an answer but there was nothing, “<em>Ay, hindi ko narinig. Haha.</em>” (Oh sorry, I didn’t hear it.” <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a>      </p>

<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2011/01/21/an-activist-looks-back-on-edsa-2/fringes-logo/" rel="attachment wp-att-38347"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fringes-logo.gif" alt="fringes-logo" width="150" height="151" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-38347" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fringes-logo.gif 150w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fringes-logo-90x90.gif 90w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/fringes-logo-64x64.gif 64w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p>In 1997, I took on a challenge and became the editor in chief of the Lyceum Independent Sentinel.</p>
<p>At first, I was a bit uneasy. Back in high school, when I was editor in chief of our student paper, there was a reliable adviser who guided us. At the Sentinel, we had no faculty adviser. We planned, wrote and critiqued our own stories.</p>
<p>We spent sleepless nights during press work. We had no computers but an old school typewriter. We edited, proofread our stories on paper. We did the literal cut-and-paste layout of our eight-page, sometimes, 12-page student publication. Usually at dawn, we would go to the printing press of then The Manila Standard located near the pier, wait for the finished layout and proofread the ‘camera-ready’ print once again before printing.</p>
<p>The smell of newspaper remains distinct in my memory. It filled us with a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>The process taught us persistence and patience. Most of us were scholars and leaders of other student organizations but we somehow managed to juggle everything. Each day, I was more excited working for the Sentinel than attending classes.</p>
<p>Being at the Sentinel also taught us respect and humility. The editors strived to maintain the style and spirit of original drafts. At the same time, we learned how not to be onion-skinned when colleagues filled our drafts with red marks.</p>
<p>As campus journalists, we valued and stood for the principles of journalism.</p>
<p>This was tested when we published a banner story stating that the Lyceum had zero passing rate in CPA examinations for three consecutive years. Our reporter Joan J. Lozada verified the information from the Professional Regulatory Commission.</p>
<p>The 10,000 copies of the said issue vanished in a few hours. One of the deans barged into our office and tore The Sentinel into bits. The dean of student affairs threatened us with closure.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sentinel-Dec-97.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="780" class="alignright size-full wp-image-99989" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sentinel-Dec-97.jpg 1080w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sentinel-Dec-97-505x365.jpg 505w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sentinel-Dec-97-768x555.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sentinel-Dec-97-840x607.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" /><br />
The next day, all the editors and staff held a meeting at Fort Santiago. Away from any intimidation and tension, we discussed all the possible scenarios. We knew we were on the side of the truth and we were ready to defend it.</p>
<p>Days and weeks went by but the administration under the leadership of Sotero H. Laurel did not lock us down. Instead, reforms were initiated to improve the performance of accountancy graduates in licensure examinations.</p>
<p>Truth was our weapon. Truth effected change.</p>
<p>The following year, the administration proposed a ten-percent tuition increase without enough basis. The Sentinel chronicled every negotiation between the administration and student leaders. I was no longer with the Sentinel at this time (I was then the president of Lyceum Journalism Society) but we used the Sentinel’s office for our meetings with other student organizations and fraternities. Here, we produced leaflets and other campaign materials and planned our next actions.</p>
<p>The campaign against tuition increase culminated in the walkout of thousands of students. The administration backed down from its proposal.</p>
<p>Truth was our weapon. Truth effected change.</p>
<p>The Sentinel was brave because it stood up for the truth. We drew our courage from our publishers, the students.</p>
<p>Twenty years later, I received news of virtual closure of The Sentinel. The administration stopped collecting publication fee this semester without prior consultation with the students. (See: <a href="http://wp.me/p7Nbdo-q0F">Lyceum admin undermines student paper&#8217;s autonomy</a>)  </p>
<p>As I’ve said, the administration has no right to replace The Sentinel. The Sentinel is a publication of, for and by the students. It belongs to the present generation of Lyceans.</p>
<p>To the Lyceans, take on the challenge. Live by Lyceum’s motto, <em>‘Veritas et fortitudo’</em> and defend the Sentinel. It is yours. Its destiny is in your hands. Don’t let it die. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<strong>By DEE AYROSO</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat</a></em></p>
<p>MANILA – I’d like to call it a meeting place, a convergence, even a junction.</p>
<p>Sitio Sandugo, the camp of the <em>Lakbayan ng Pambansang Minorya,</em> was put up along C.P. Garcia avenue at the Old Stud Farm of the University of the Philippines, Diliman from Aug. 31 to Sept. 22. It was the realization of UP’s promise to give a physical base to the national minorities’ alliance, Sandugo, to support their struggle for ancestral lands and self-determination, as well as to help rectify history.</p>
<p>It was my place of destination for stories on this year’s Lakbayan. Having gone to the Manilakbayan/Lakbayan camps in the past three years, I expected to be swamped with more stories than I can write. But it was not just the myriad stories, but the energy of the people, the vibe of the place, which enthralled me and made it another memorable year.</p>
<p>I made friends, received a gift, had precious coffee time with relatives, and learned things I didn’t know about the national minorities.</p>
<p>Oh, it is so much more than a camp.</p>

<p>Sitio Sandugo created a focal point where the Bangsamoro and indigenous peoples meet with the “majority” – Filipinos whose tribal roots were cut and lost in hundreds of years of colonization.</p>
<p>It is also where groups from the north meet those from the south, the east, the west. The old meets the young. The city meets the countryside. The mainstream meets the alternative. Generations combine, and what were in the fringes come together to the center.</p>
<p>With designated sections per region, the place is a virtual portal to the ongoing struggle of national minorities in different places around the country. The Lakbayan delegates, or <em>lakbayanis,</em> share the problems they face in their homes: landgrabbing, destructive mining and energy projects, expansion of plantations, human rights violations, and yes, war.</p>

The &#8220;lecture rooms&#8221; in sitio Sandugo. A member of Tindeg Ranao discusses with students, while on the other side speaks a Lumad leader from Northern Mindanao.</figcaption></figure>
<p>This year, among the lakbayanis were evacuees from war-torn Marawi city, whose homes and lives were destroyed by the military operations, which go on up to this writing. Their hut was at the far end of the camp, inside the Bangsamoro section. There was also a <em>masjid</em> set up for prayers.</p>
<p>Many of the lakbayanis are victims, and most, if not all, are activists. Naturally, along with their stories of harassment, attacks, death and destruction, are stories of hope and optimism that things will get better – because people unite and act together.</p>

<p>And sitio Sandugo is a perfect example of people’s unity and collective action. Here are more reasons why you should go next year:</p>
<p><strong>It’s a socio-political convention.</strong> Discussions were held daily under the giant multi-colored tent which served as a plaza. Sectoral groups took turns leading the forum, on land, LGBT rights, Islamophobia, the nationality question, and even on the agreements signed by government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP). Resource persons come from the academe, the progressives, the sectoral support groups.</p>
<p><strong>It’s one big classroom.</strong> Students from UP and various universities streamed in, because sitio Sandugo is a big “school,” with different lecture rooms. UP Chancellor Michael Tan called the lakbayanis the “visiting professors,” as they teach about issues of the Cordillerans, Lumad, Mangyan, Aetas, Dumagats, the Bangsamoro and various other groups.</p>
<p>Visitors learn, not just about the indigenous culture, but mostly about their valiant defense of their ancestral territories throughout history – the main reason why they have preserved their culture and the rich natural resources in their lands, and also why they continue to be subjected to national oppression.</p>
<p><strong>It’s one big art gallery.</strong> Various progressive visual artists stayed in and created art in sitio Sandugo. The camp cranked out murals and effigies. Many were burned in the series of Lakbayan protests, still, many were kept and hung around the long huts, and added visual layers to the ethnic hues of black and red, and the green of the foliage around the camp.</p>

<p>Indigenous works of art, such as bead jewelries and woven cloths, were not just worn by lakbayanis, but also sold to visitors.</p>
<p>One can have hours of visual treat, watching the big artworks come together, such as UgatLahi’s “Rody(k)’s Cube,” and the Duterte missile-riding Trump. But smaller works of art were made, not on paper, canvass or wood, but on people’s skin, to the rhythmic tapping sound of the <em>mambabatok</em> (tattoo artist) at work. People queued up to get <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2017/09/07/sitio-sandugo-place-rich-cultures-stories-struggles-plus-tattoo-anyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skin art from Jasmine Adaol from Kalinga,</a> who sat at the back of the Sandugo Museo.</p>

<p>Speaking of Museo, it has evolved from the Museo Lumad, and now showcases products of the Bangsamoro and indigenous peoples: hunting and farming tools, musical instruments, basketry, weapons, and various memorabilia of their struggle. This includes a replica of <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2017/04/26/cordillera-day-macliing-dulag-cordillera-heroes-memorial-unveiled-kalinga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the marker of three Cordillera heroes built along a Kalinga roadside</a> this year.</p>
<p><strong>There&#8217;s a concert every night.</strong> Every night was cultural solidarity night. A formidable list of performers mixed mainstream musicians with the alternative. Cultural groups and bands from various UP colleges also took to the stage. Poets, like those from KM 64 and Kamandag, also had their turn.</p>
<p>But the main stars were the regional groups, who performed their songs, dances and skits, that depict their stories as peoples fighting for their land and their rights. My forever favorite is Dap-ayan ti Kultura iti Kordilyera, or DKK.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, the Bangsamoro and indigenous peoples donned their traditional attire and performed songs and dances, NOT to entertain, as government would have them do in front of tourists, but to showcase their centuries-old culture and ways, preserved by their warrior tradition of defense of ancestral lands, which they carry on to the present day, and to which they enjoin people to support.</p>
<p>I mean, the whole context is their continuing struggle, not some tourism gimmick. The tribal <em>war</em> dance is not just for show.</p>
<p><strong>It’s one big healing center.</strong> Lakbayanis and visitors alike were given treatments in acupuncture, acupressure, <em>hilot</em> or traditional massage, and Western medicine. Progressive health workers set up and maintained a clinic inside the camp, where many health professionals volunteered and gave medical assistance to the delegates.</p>

<p>Now, if only they had a psych section…er, someone I know needs to get checked.</p>
<p><strong>There’s an impromptu reunion waiting to happen.</strong> Old friends and colleagues unexpectedly found themselves collected in one place. It was a place to catch up on former co-workers and their family, former activists who came to give support to the growing strength of national minorities.</p>
<p>Case in point was a meet-up of indigenous rights activists from the 80s, now all middle-aged. Among them was a daughter of their colleague, Mikmik, who took the place of her late mother, pioneering Dumagat leader, Marilyn Quierrez. Along with Mikmik was her eight-month-old son, Lenin, hopefully, their third generation of activist.</p>

<p>Another case in point: Among the Cordilleran lakbayanis were my aunt, a cousin and a nephew whom I have not seen in years! And they <em>do</em> compose three generations of activists.</p>
<p>I think no one leaves sitio Sandugo without taking something from the camp, whether it’s a pair of beaded earrings, a tubaw, a selfie by the standees, a sip of coffee from a coconut shell, a book, a new friend. A heart-wrenching story. Searing pain from a tattoo. Maybe, even a new direction in life.</p>
<p>Sitio Sandugo is a place of fusion, where various indigenous peoples groups converge, along with the Bangsamoro, non-tribals, each acquiring a positive aspect from the others as they flow together stronger towards a new direction, like a river coursing from a junction.</p>
<p>So, next time, make it a date. It’s best to come as a group, with friends, colleagues. Bring young children.</p>
<p>Until next year, sitio Sandugo! <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<strong>By GINO ESTELLA</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat</a></em></p>
<p>Days after my visit to Camp Bagong Diwa, a stunning thought came to my mind as to why these political detainees remain cooped up in jail cells. In jail cells, up on the third or fourth floor of buildings, with cold concrete floors for beds, where they sleep for months up to years. The mere existence of prisons&#8211;at least in the Philippines&#8211;is neither for the reform nor repentance of criminals, rather, they are in there to die.</p>
<p>While many anthropological texts believe prisons were manifestations of mankind’s progression from capital punishment to societal reclusion, the case for the Philippines is that the accused who are detained and with ongoing cases are already practically condemned without due process.</p>
<p>To clarify, jails do not serve as detainment centers for those convicted&#8211;that’s what prisons are for. Jails keep those serving short sentences and those with ongoing trial. Prisons keep the convicted for the term of their sentence.</p>
<p>Not so long ago, the Batangas Provincial Jail held a “Flores de Druglord,” making a mockery of alleged drug pushers by parading them around town, and telling people not to be like them. Many were indeed involved in drug-related activities, and many were also not yet convicted.</p>
<p>As I walked the halls of the female “dorm” of the Taguig City Jail, it did not take a moment until I noticed the disturbing writing on the walls. Detainees were made to “repent,” with signs saying “I am here because I could not escape myself,” or “I will repent for crimes in here, away from them.”</p>
<p>It is unsettling to note that not only people condemn the accused before their case’s conclusion, jails as well, have joined in on the “fun.”</p>
<p>The political detainees were not there because they needed to repent for their crimes. They were in there because the government did not want them to speak louder than they usually do. Political detainees are behind bars because they dared to go against the status quo.</p>
<p>The jails and prisons are to keep the criminal away from society. Perhaps that is why the past administration intended to keep political detainees inside&#8211;to keep them away from making changes.</p>
<p>KARAPATAN calls the cases of the political detainees “criminalized” cases. Charges against them were made criminal, and thus the state refuses to admit the existence of political prisoners in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Of over 500 political prisoners in the Philippines, I can count with my hand the few that have had their cases closed. Convicted or not, it is a terrible injustice for them to undergo the incredibly slow “justice” process. </p>
<p>From my jail visit to political detainees, I found it saddening to hear about the stories of state neglect within the prison.</p>
<p>It is disturbing to hear that the late political detainee Eduardo Serrano was right outside the jail’s “infirmary” when he had cardiac arrest. </p>
<p>It is sad to hear that Miradel Torres was kept for weeks on end before she was allowed to receive medical care as she was bleeding from her pregnancy, and after her son’s birth, she was separated from him.</p>
<p>I fear for the lives of the political detainees in the Batangas Provincial Jail and other jails, when they were under heat for fighting for the rights of their fellow detainees, or when they exposed the rotten conditions within their jail cells.</p>
<p>Sharon Cabusao, the recently-freed political detainee once talked about the subpar conditions within jail. Decent food was a luxury, and healthcare was more of something that people do not talk about anymore because of the lack of it.</p>
<p>I realized that within these cells are stories of millions of detainees, who were jailed whether for political, criminal or other reasons. They tell of people whose activism was met with handcuffs, and protest met with grave threats. As they languish in jail, they have shown that the politics have not ceased behind bars. </p>
<p>However, the political detainee is still an activist. Sharon said they fought for an increased food allowance, healthcare for their fellow detainee, and even a right to sleep outside the cell during the hot summer months.</p>
<p>It is a long process, but the detainees know their rights and they have campaigned for them in the past. The things they do inside are no different from what they do beyond the cell walls. </p>
<p>Now, while they have achieved these comforts within jail, it still stands: they are not supposed to be there.</p>
<p>The political detainee is almost like being dead. They do not see their families, they stagnate in small concrete boxes they call “living” space, and for long, they are forgotten through the endless days away from society; and through those endless days, they lose their dignity, as well as their life.</p>
<p>The Aquino government thought it has successfully “killed” them. As they claimed, the detainees do not exist, “There are no political detainees in the country.”</p>
<p>But look again: we have not forgotten the political detainees. They are still fighting, not just for freedom for themselves, but for social changes for the whole country. Their call must reverberate around the Philippines. </p>

<p><strong>By GINO ESTELLA</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat</a></em><br />
I love covering rallies and mobilizations.</p>
<p>There is something about being in the middle of action. In a moment of heightened emotions, there is no telling what one will say or do. In places such as EDSA, Mendiola, the US Embassy or Commonwealth Avenue will you find the smallest stories relevant.</p>
<p>Small stories such as an old lady walking hundreds of miles to protest, or a laborer skipping work to denounce an abusive system; you will meet the politically acute and the illiterate in one setting, united for one cause.</p>
<p>The mobilization is indeed a boiling pot of humanity’s stories in a single setting. However, many things go awry in such a place. Of course, there is the assertion&#8211;or pushing through&#8211;that the media loves to cover; and what a story to cover, when there is conflict involved.</p>
<p>As a journalist who has mostly worked in the alternative context and seldom in the mainstream, I rely&#8211;and relish&#8211;being on the ground to tell the stories of those in the grassroots. Thus, I integrate with the crowd, sometimes involving myself a little bit too much.</p>
<p>My favorite place is along the front lines. Activists call the first row the “composite unit” or “compo,” which is tasked to move the crowd forward, as well as protect them from any harm. That is where I can get the best shots, and personally, I prefer to walk with the masses, rather than wait for them at the point where the police await to stop them in their track. Like I said, I should not, but I tend involve myself a bit too much in the front lines.</p>
<p>I do not know. Maybe it is to get a great shot of the events, or maybe I really wanted to see the groups on the other side, over the lines of police blocking them. Either way, with a 40mm lens, I was not left with much of a choice than be at the front lines.</p>
<p>I remember my most recent coverage of an assertion. Progressive youth groups hounded “Citizen Noynoy” at his abode along Times Street. They were calling for his immediate arrest and incarceration for his crimes against the youth and the masses, as they put it, as perpetrator of state neglect.</p>
<p>The small street was lined with iron fences for blockades, and behind those blockades were layers upon layers of police (who were supposed to be serving under a new president already). There were dozens of cameras, and I was (not) surprised to see that it was not only the media who held the cameras. The police&#8211;for surveillance, I guess&#8211;took pictures of the placards, props, tarpaulins and of course, all the people there, even me.</p>
<p>The program was short, and it only lasted for half an hour. Afterwards, the activists dropped their large tarps and props, and struggled to break through the solid phalanx that is the police and their blockades.</p>
<p>It was tense, and I can bet that it was confusing for everyone there. You shift to an almost immediate fight-or-flight disposition, and you quickly learn that you need to defend yourself and the others, all while pushing through the lines of police.</p>
<figure id="attachment_91775" style="width: 2000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/img_5668/"><img class="size-full wp-image-91775" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_5668.jpg" alt="(Photo by Gino Estella/Bulatlat)" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_5668.jpg 2000w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_5668-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_5668-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_5668-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/IMG_5668-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(Photo by Gino Estella/Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There were police threatening to hit the youth activists with their batons, and there were many who made false swipes to deter them as well. Nonetheless, the youth fought back with their placards, and whatever they can get their hands on.</p>
<p>I was right there on the front lines. Beside me was a youth activist, who got a hold of a fern with which he could retaliate, swiping it at the police officer in front of him. The police fought with shields and batons, while the youth fought with placards. By instinct, I tried to break off the impending altercation, along with other people we tried to make sure nobody was hurt.</p>
<p>Moments after, and like clockwork, the police asserted their dominance by pushing the youth back. A policeman behind me was holding two batons, and I was among the people he was pushing away from the street.</p>
<p>His look was threatening, and he seemed as if he was using his two batons as additional threats. I do not know if he wanted to hit me, but before anything could happen, I glanced at his nameplate and immediately shouted his name.</p>
<p>I was almost lecturing him. I roared at him, telling him that I was part of the media. I asked him what his business was, holding two wooden batons threateningly at the youth.</p>
<p>He quickly reverted to another disposition, and as I showed him my press card, he immediately turned apologetic. I was fuming at that moment, and I only wanted all the tension and violence to stop.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it was a moment where I had an ethical lapse. I was in the scene as a reporter, but my human instincts directed me to prevent anyone from hurting anyone or getting hurt themselves. It is in this moment that an ethical conundrum is presented. When the person in front of you is about to be hit by a thick wooden stick, do you report about it or do you help that person?</p>
<figure id="attachment_91644" style="width: 2000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2016/06/30/youth-protesters-hound-citizen-noynoy-at-times-street/img_5726/" rel="attachment wp-att-91644"><img class="size-full wp-image-91644" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_5726.jpg" alt="(Photo by Gino Estella/Bulatlat)" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_5726.jpg 2000w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_5726-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_5726-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_5726-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_5726-272x182.jpg 272w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(Photo by Gino Estella/Bulatlat)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As for me, I will go with the section in the Society of Professional Journalists’ code of ethics that says Minimize Harm&#8211;physical harm, that is. Report about the event, then, help the person. Though, the case might be different for other journalists. They might opt to do the opposite, or something different, of course.</p>
<p>However, police should also be enjoined to minimize harm. Their presence at Times Street could mean protecting the residents, but it could also mean preventing activists from getting anywhere near their former master.</p>
<p>Above all, the police should exercise maximum tolerance. Perhaps the police have heard this all too frequently, but their motto is “To serve and protect”&#8211;but to serve and protect whom?</p>
<p>This story of mine is only a story among many. The narrative of the assertion is a narrative that repeats itself. This narrative can only change when its players change as well.</p>
<p>To the media, cover the situation differently. While this dissent between two sides seems reminiscent of war journalism, it most certainly is not a war: it is a group of people seeking to be heard.</p>
<p>That is what I love about covering mobilizations and rallies. It is about people who want to be heard&#8211;let us hear them out.<a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat " src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<strong>Ni TILDE ACUÑA</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>Ang mga may-ari ang nagsasabi kung ano ang maaari at ang hindi, ang kanilang papayagan at pipigilan, ang kanilang hahayaan, hihiyain, ipahihinto, itutuloy, yayariin, wawasakin. Ganito sa pambansa at pandaigdigang antas. Inaangkin ng mga hayok magkamal ng yaman maging ang mga salita; nasa kamay rin nila ang pamamahagi ng mga ito at ng iba pa, pagtukoy kung sinong makikinabang sa mga ito, pagpili kung sinong maeetsapwera sa alin. Bagamat nasa kamay ngayon ng iilan ang lahat, nasa bisig nating lahat ang pagbawi.</p>
<p>Halimbawa, mas madaling maisakatuparan ang kanilang OO at HINDI, samantalang kinakailangan pa ng daan, libo, daanlibo, milyong pirma, pakikilahok, pagkilos upang irehistro ang hinaing laban sa pagsasakatuparan o hindi nila ng batas; dagdag pa, sa hawak nilang mga institusyon, mas mabilis maipalaganap at maipatanggap ang nais nilang ipabatid, nais ipakahulugan, nais ibigay at bawiin, nais ipahintulot at ipagbawal. Mapabubulaanan ang monopolyo nila sa katotohanan ng pagpapakahulugang muli sa mga salita:</p>
<p><strong>Boto.</strong> Maaaring makaboto ang taumbayan, pero hindi sila maaaring makapagluklok ng pangulo. Sa pamimili (salitang ugat: bili at pili) pa lang ng makatatakbo sa pagka-anuman, malapad na ang papel ng mga makapangyarihan sa negosyo at burukrasya: ang sinusuportahan nila ang magwawagi at makapapanatili hanggang matapos ang termino. Kundi kaibigan sa politika, kamag-anak at iba pang nasa sirkulo nila ang makauupo sa napagkasunduang pwesto. Teritoryong minana ng iilang angkan ang mga lupain at mga taong naninirahan sa mga ito: ang mga taong maaaring makaboto, pero hindi maaaring makapagluklok ng pangulo.</p>
<p><strong>Bangko.</strong> Maaaring mangampanya ang taumbayan, maaaring magwagi ang ikinampanya nila upang maging mambabatas, pero hindi madaling maipapatupad ang panukalang batas ng mga kinatawan nila. Hindi lang sa lokal na may-ari nakasalalay ang kahihinatnan ng halalan at ang pamahalaang ibubunga ng “demokratikong proseso.” Mayroong mas malalaking mga may-ari sa mga lokal na may-ari at ito ang kapitapitagang mga bangkong namamahala sa sanlibutan at nagtatakda ng mga maaari at hindi ng sino at ng alin: ang International Monetary Fund at World Bank, ang mga may-ari ng demokrasya at huwaran ng soberanya. Hindi totoong walang nakatataas sa batas—o sa bibliya. Negosyo ang batas, neoliberalismo ang bibliya, bangko ang panginoon. Erehe ang sinumang magtatanong kung bakit.</p>
<p><strong>Batas.</strong> Maaaring maipatupad ang panukalang batas ng nailuklok na kandidato kung pabor ito sa interes ng dayuhang kapital at adyendang neoliberal; samantala, ibibinbin ang panukala o ibabasura ng mayora ng mga mambabatas (o di kaya’y i-ve-veto ng presidente) kung kokontra, direkta man o di-direkta, sa interes ng IMF-WB. Hindi maaaring payagan ang mga panukalang batas tulad ng nasyunalisasyong industriyal, repormang agraryo, edukasyon para sa lahat at iba pang islogang makabuluhan para sa 99% ng mamamayan pero abstrakto sa 1% na nagsasabing lipas na ang mga panawagan dahil sa kasosyo sila sa negosyo ng mga korporasyong multinasyunal at panginoon sila ng ilang ektraryang asyenda. Maaaring lumabag sa batas, depende sa perang nakaimbak sa bangko at rekursong handing ibayad upang makabili ng laya.</p>
<p><strong>Bago.</strong> Maaaring mangampanya ang taumbayan, maipanalo ang kanilang kandidato, magpanukala ng batas ang kinatawan, pero hindi maaaring maging sapat ang elektoral na tagumpay upang baguhin at baliktarin ang sistemang nakasandig sa relasyong panginoon-alipin na pinagtitibay ng kontrata ng Pilipinas sa IMF-WB. Maaaring lumahok sa halalan, anila at ng mga kasapakat nila, pero hindi maaaring hayaang guminhawa ang mamamayang may-utang sa amin, maliban na lang katuwang sila sa pang-aalipin. Sapat na ang bagong mukha, dagdag nila at ng mga kasapakat nila, upang masabing mayroong pagbabago at maaring muling mangarap—pero may hangganan ang pangangarap, hanggang doon lang sa itinakda nilang maaari mong makamit.</p>
<p>Sa kanilang mga itinakdang maaari at hindi, maaari tayong pumayag, maaari tayong pumalag, pero hindi maaaring wala tayong hakbang na gawin, dahil ang hindi natin paghakbang, paurong man o pasulong, ay nangangahulugan ng pagpayag na mapanatili ang kasalukuyang kalakaran: sila ang nagtatakda ng maaari at hindi. Maaaring hindi muna humakbang, paurong man o pasulong, upang magnilaynilay, pero hindi maaaring habambuhay magmatyag at maghintay sa kapalarang isinakatuparan, isinasakatuparan at isasakatuparan ng mga humirang sa mga hari, nagluklok sa mga presidente at nagbasbas sa mga diktador.</p>
<p>Sa ilalim ng kasalukuyang kalagayan ng lipunang ito, maaari tayong bumoto, pero hindi tayo makapagluluklok ng pamunuang lulutas sa sistemang pinagbabawalan tayong magluklok. Pero lalahok tayo sa halalan dahil maaari, at hindi dahil doon magsisimula ang pagbabagong inaasam; lalahok tayo sa halalan dahil hindi natin hahayaan lamang sa mga kawatang mapanlamang ang larangang ito. Lalahok tayo sa halalan dahil hinahayaan tayong bumoto upang patikimin tayo ng patak ng demokrasya at kalayaang nilalanguyan ng mga korporasyon at mga tagapamahala nitong burukrata; lalahok tayo sa halalan nang isinasaisip ang kasabihang Aprikano: tuyong damo ang magpapasilab sa basang damo. Sa ilalim ng kasalukuyang kalagayan, sa ilalim magmumula ang pagbabago ayon sa ating pakahulugan.</p>
<p>*<em>Ilang dekada na nang bigkasin ang talumpating pinaghalawan ng pamagat ng aklat ni Eduardo Galeanong &#8220;We Say No&#8221; (1992), pero nangungusap pa rin ito sa ating panahon at espasyo. Karamihan ng kaisipang nasa sanaysay na ito ay igib sa naturang libro na tiyak na inigib ng Latino Amerikanong awtor sa sambayanang kanyang nakasalamuha. Iniangkop na lamang sa kamalayang Pilipinong inakala at sinasapantaha ng may-akda.</em> <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a></p>

<p><strong>By DEE AYROSO</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>He goes to court hearings and news coverage, butts in conversations, attacks the TV and eats like there’s no tomorrow. He is Martin, the cat with an unstoppable sarcasm that has been residing in my head since late 2014, and one of the many voices that push me to draw something, anything&#8230;today&#8230;here, right now. </p>
<p>Martin, <em>Bulatlat</em>’s “everywhere cat” was based on Alex, the late Alexander Martin Remollino, former <em>Bulatlat</em> writer and a Bayan staff at the time of his untimely passing. The cat’s chinky eyes and black fur that flows into a pony-tail shaped patch down to his tail were based on Alex’s, well, chinky eyes and long hair gathered in a pony tail. The flair for words, voracious appetite and laidback attitude was based on him, too. </p>
<p>When I returned to <em>Bulatlat</em> in July 2014, the staff welcomed the idea of a comic strip, and did not mind that I have absolutely no training in drawing. We wanted someone to express what we can’t say in feature articles and editorials. Who could do it best than a Bulatlat family member whose sarcasm and classic character continues to be part of conversations on the staff’s triumphs and misadventures, long after he was called to cover the Great Beyond? </p>
<p>Alex’s cat-ego jumped into <em>Bulatlat</em>’s page, in Martin’s Purrspective, which gives literally sharp-clawed “analysis” in contrast to Benjie Oliveros’s more serious Bulatlat Perspective. Since then, Martin had scratched the eyes of “The Butcher,” pissed on the TV, talked to a radioactive rat in the former US bases, sang-along to the President’s speech, and meowed his way into arguments.</p>
<p>But Martin’s rantings had evolved into more than just something Alex would say. Martin also reflects part of the staff’s musings: Janess’s “scenes we’d like to see” in court hearings, Benjie’s more rational treatment of what would otherwise be politically incorrect jokes, issues besetting the mothers among the staff (who are the majority), and sometimes, even jokes suggested by readers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Purrfect@15.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-88512"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Purrfect@15.jpg" alt="Purrfect@15" width="2928" height="1261" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-88512" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Purrfect@15.jpg 2928w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Purrfect@15-660x284.jpg 660w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Purrfect@15-768x331.jpg 768w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Purrfect@15-840x362.jpg 840w" sizes="(max-width: 2928px) 100vw, 2928px" /></a></p>
<p>Martin’s wry humour may rarely evoke loud laughter, but he still gets his wit across, just when our top stories are having a slow day.</p>
<p>The cat is also rarely alone now, and has a dog pal to rant and joke with: Waffle the Belgian Shepherd, who is Martin’s kinder, more sensitive version. Last year, another commenter flew in on the strip after the Mamasapano encounter, when the Peace Dove became the Pissed Dove, even more quick-tempered than Martin, and has a vocabulary that includes images of poop, lightning and deadly weapons.</p>
<p>Aside from drawing wisecracking, opinionated animals (as an actual job, at that!), what I love most about making Martin, is the chance to put in ink and gauche the running conversations inside my head. Sometimes the voices sound strangely the same, like they came from the same crazy person. But with Martin around, everyone is welcome to sit, talk, clown around and even sing in the room: the hothead, the contemplative, the sly, the streetsmart, the naive and foolish, the regular crazy. </p>
<p>They are all never, ever shutting up.<br />

UMIL</strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em></p>
<p>It was February 2010 when I was “hired” to write for <em>Bulatlat</em> by then managing editor (now editor in chief) Benjie Oliveros . My objective then was to further hone my writing skills as my previous work was not lined with my journalism degree. I was already married and with children then, but I really wanted to pursue a career in writing. </p>
<p>My grandmother – who sent me and all of my siblings to college – said that there is no money in journalism. That was why I did not consider getting a writing job after I left my first job as advocacy officer in a non-government organization. Because I already had children then, I considered taking other jobs with good enough salary to send my children to school. So, for five years I worked as an administrative officer in another non-government organization with a relatively higher salary.</p>
<p>But then I realized it was not just about the salary. As time passed, I began to be more aware of the social and political condition in the country, and I thought maybe I could do more other than office work. I thought about working as a writer, but didn’t have the courage to leave the job and apply in a media outfit. </p>
<p>I kept thinking about the future of my children. I was also becoming restless (or maybe agitated), and can’t stop thinking that I can do more than clerical work. I considered writing for <em>Bulatlat,</em> but I also knew that it would also mean lesser income. I know <em>Bulatlat</em> is independent and non-profit, and there is no advertisement which could bring in additional income. Thankfully, I have a supportive husband who encouraged me to follow my heart. So, in the past six years I have been in <em>Bulatlat</em>.</p>
<p>But why work for <em>Bulatlat</em> when I can apply in corporate media which gives higher salary?</p>
<p>I was not only honing my writing skills in <em>Bulatlat</em>, but also deepening the commitment to serve the people’s interests and their struggles.</p>
<p>Working for <em>Bulatlat</em>, I understand more about the root cause of the Filipino people’s suffering as we write about them. We write stories that seldom land in the front page of broadsheets and or get broadcast in primetime television. It means covering fact-finding missions to a province where farmers’ lands were being grabbed by corporations and big landlords, or on certain human rights abuses committed by the state security forces in the countryside. We get the people’s point of view on issues of privatization of government services: we ask the employees, the patients and the lesser-known stakeholders, the experts that contradict this policy and not merely serve as a mouthpiece of big corporations and the bureaucracy. </p>
<p><em>Bulatlat</em> was there to get the story in the court hearings of the disappeared UP students, Sherlyn Cadapan and Karen Empeño, in the continuing oppression and land grabbing of President Aquno&#8217;s clan in Hacienda Luisita which had been ordered to be distributed by the Supreme Court order, in the mass actions of farmers, students, government employees and workers who voice out dissent against oppressive laws and government policies, whether they come by the thousands, or just a handful. The list goes on.   </p>
<p>It is gratifying to be appreciated by people who thank <em>Bulatlat</em> for writing about their side of the issue, as opposed to how they deplore certain cases of twisting by the corporate media.</p>
<p>After six years I know my decision to work for <em>Bulatlat</em> was the right one. There is no denying that we have needs to address, but because I know the reasons why life is such a struggle for the ordinary people, the working class and poorest of the poor, it gives me no reason to leave this work and seek greener pasture. I won’t be hypocrite, I don’t know what lies ahead, but what is important is now. And now, I want to be an instrument for the people to attain social change, so that in the future, my children and maybe all Filipino children will live in a society much better than the society we have today.<br />

OLEA </strong><br />
<em><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com">Bulatlat.com</a></em> </p>
<p>Sometimes, I have sleepless nights.</p>
<p>It usually happens after a difficult coverage. Images of the persons I interviewed come to mind. How are the farmers in Hacienda Luisita and Hacienda Dolores?  Have the urban poor in Isla Puting Bato rebuilt their shanties after the fire? Have the contractual employees of GMA 7 received their salaries? How are the relatives of the disappeared?</p>
<p>I let out a sigh to relieve the heaviness in my chest. </p>
<p>I write stories of ordinary people. I get details about their personal circumstances. It’s not easy not to be affected, especially if I see the children of those farmers, workers, urban poor, indigenous peoples.</p>
<p>Their lives have become miserable in the name of “development.”  Thousands of farmers in Hacienda Dolores, Porac, Pampanga are being evicted from the land they have tilled for decades to pave the way for Ayala Land’s Alviera project. The urban poor in Isla Puting Bato, Tondo are being driven away purportedly for the port modernization. Hundreds of GMA 7 talents (the euphemism used by the management for their contractual employees) have been retrenched to improve the network’s ratings and to increase profits. Activists fighting for the poor are snatched away from their loved ones.</p>
<p>Such stories do not usually appear in the major dailies. Corporate media outfits do not report issues that contradict the business interests of their owners or their advertisers. The Cojuangco-Aquino clan continues to wrest control of the vast hacienda, and President Aquino utilizes the entire state machinery to do this. The Ayala clan is among the richest in the country and they have advertisements in the media. Issues of the urban poor are not usually deemed newsworthy by the corporate media unless there is a bloody demolition. The rival networks would not report the labor dispute at GMA 7 because they have the same practices of exploiting their employees.</p>
<p>I would say journalism is a blessing as it is a curse. Writing is my only way of trying to help out those whose voices are either unheard or muted. There are times I feel it is not enough.</p>
<p>Then again, I would like to believe that telling their stories somehow provide them even a tinge of hope. That in the mere act of listening, they know they deserve to be heard. It is okay to break what Paolo Freire calls the “culture of silence” which has been imposed upon them by the powers-that-be.</p>
<p>Freire points out that people’s participation is essential in development. To quote: “When they participate and construct their own history they become the subject of ‘authentic development.’” </p>
<p>The United Nation Research Institute for Social Development defines participation as “organised effort to increase control over resources and institutions for groups hitherto excluded from such control.”</p>
<p>In the many communities I visited for coverage, I witness how many Davids band together to confront the Goliaths. This they do to defend their resources, livelihood, right to decent living, to fight for what to them is “authentic development.”</p>
<p>I am happy to play a modest role in the quest for authentic development of ordinary people. Although I know there would be more sleepless nights, I draw my inspiration from my sources – whose strength relies on their unity and whose hope depends on their continuing struggle for a better life. <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com"><img title="This story is from Bulatlat.com" src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bulatlat_tagline.jpg" alt="(https://www.bulatlat.com)" height="16" /></a> </p>

<p>MANILA – When I searched for netizens’ thoughts about the commemoration of martial law last Monday, Sept. 21, I stumbled upon a number of tweets saying good things about it. </p>
<p>“Martial law years were better than today because people were more disciplined, there were less crimes, the economy was better,” and so on. People made comments as if they lived through those days. The commenters’ profiles, however, showed that they are young, somwhere in their early 20s or 30s and certainly did not experience one of the most horrific eras of Philippine history. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p lang="tl" dir="ltr">Sa totoo lang i never heard a bad thing sa martial law from my grand parents and parents. Peaceful pa nga daw noon eh.</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p lang="tl" dir="ltr">I&#39;ve read some negative comments about Marcos and Martial Law. Daming keme. Eh bakit hanggang ngayon wala pa ring evidences against him?</p>
<p>&mdash; Majoy. (@xxMryJySldrJkch) <a href="https://twitter.com/xxMryJySldrJkch/status/646525162339221506">September 23, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>I wasn’t yet born during Martial Law either. In my history class (Sibika) in elementary, the Marcos era was highlighted with the construction of facilities such as the Philippine Heart Center, the Cultural Center of the Philippines and LRT. I recalled our teacher saying many infrastructures were built during those years. But he also said many were also killed during that time, especially those who opposed the Marcos government. </p>
<p>If there are so many “millennials” who are grateful for what Marcos “did for the country” – in spite of the human rights violations &#8212; does this mean that so much is not being discussed in history class these days? </p>
<p>I asked my eldest daughter who is in Grade 7 if they talked about Martial Law during her elementary years and she said yes. She said the teacher said it was more peaceful during those days, cleaner but the President was strict and no one dared oppose him. So I asked her if she thinks Martial Law was  good? She said if the president was strict and no one dared oppose him, then it was not good. </p>
<p>“There was no freedom,” she said. So I asked if the teacher mentioned the people killed and imprisoned during those years, and she said there was none. </p>
<p>The League of Filipino Students in UP Diliman came up with an infographic that would probably awaken those who admire the dictatorship: </p>
<p><a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2015/09/27/martial-law-was-just-ok/otf-zeng-lfs-infographics/" rel="attachment wp-att-85326"><img src="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/otf-zeng-lfs-infographics.jpg" alt="otf-zeng-lfs infographics" width="566" height="564" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-85326" srcset="https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/otf-zeng-lfs-infographics.jpg 566w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/otf-zeng-lfs-infographics-366x365.jpg 366w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/otf-zeng-lfs-infographics-200x200.jpg 200w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/otf-zeng-lfs-infographics-90x90.jpg 90w, https://www.bulatlat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/otf-zeng-lfs-infographics-64x64.jpg 64w" sizes="(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px" /></a></p>
<p>It showed the widening gap between the riches of the rich and the poorest of the poor.  Wages were low, poverty incidence was high. The country’s foreign debt was the largest in Asia, and has been a legacy that generations of Filipinos continue to pay. </p>
<p>The LFS said that the “myth of economic growth during the Marcos era” was primarily driven by foreign investment. </p>
<p>“Marcos also heavily relied on foreign debt in order to implement much of his projects. The ‘growth’ under these kinds of neoliberal policies is far from inclusive and has only made our nation heavily indebted. Big businesses and the elite were the ones who benefited from Marcos’ economic policies while worsening the conditions of the Filipino people,” they added.</p>
<p>About the peace and order that some millenials cite, the Amnesty International said there were 70,000 arrested individuals, 34,000 victims of torture, 3,240 salvaged or summarily executed and 1,000 disappeared. </p>
<p>If you have seen <a href="https://www.bulatlat.com/2010/07/15/sigwa-reliving-the-first-quarter-storm-of-1970/ ">“Sigwa,” a movie about the First Quarter Storm during the 1970s</a>, then you would know why the youths of the 60s and 70s felt the need to revolt. Poverty was massive; there were also no jobs for the urban poor. There was political repression and those who dissented against the government were thrown in jail, if not killed. Somebody had to stand for the people’s welfare. Who wouldn’t revolt if you do not have freedom to oppose or express your opposition?     </p>
<p>I have read one post from a netizen whose parents were both illegally detained during martial law. She did not detail her parents’ ordeal, but as a child to her parents, she is deeply hurt by what happened. She stressed that her parents’ illegal detention is a FACT (she wrote it in all caps). She said every time she sees posts or status glorifying martial law, she feel like being victimized. She said by glorifying martial law, it’s as if her pain and struggle is not real. That what happened to her parents and many Filipinos were not real. She said we live in a democratic country and everyone is free to express their opinion but she also urged those who glorify Martial Law to respect her and others’ pain as well.</p>
<p>Those who were tortured during the Martial Law years and have survived today still suffer some physical impairment and even trauma. </p>
<p>What would they say to those who say, “Forgive and move on”?</p>
<p>Lack of awareness of what really happened during Martial Law is alarming. What’s more alarming is that there will be no more Philippine history subject in 2016, when the senior high school of the K to 12 program will be implemented in full swing.     </p>
<p>There is so much that we have to learn about Martial Law. Many of these stories may be discussed inside the classroom but there is more outside the four corners of your classrooms. We don’t know anything about living with curfews and with armed Philippine Constabulary roaming around the city. Many may not have a family member, or know of anyone who was a victim of human rights abuses during Martial Law, but the younger generation should hear the stories of the people who lived and experienced human rights abuses during those years.  </p>
<p>I got to know more about the horrors of martial law when I covered the human rights beat. Many of those I interviewed for my articles about Martial Law said government was so ruthless. Protesters get beaten up, snatched, teargassed, imprisoned and tortured. Once you were identified that you were against the government, you were targeted. But the brave and daring youth did not falter and continued with their struggle.</p>
<p>Let’s put ourselves in their shoes and just imagine. Should I just shut up and live as if there is nothing wrong in the country, when poverty is rampant and the President, his cronies and relatives continue to amass wealth from corrupt practices? </p>
<p>I don’t think so.  </p>
